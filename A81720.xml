            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T's one of the Devil's prime Engines to pervert Divine Ordinances quite contrary to their primitive inſtitution: ſo he did in Paradiſe, ſo he did in the Jewiſh Church, and ſo he hath done a long time, and ſtill doth in the Chriſtian Church. No wonder then if he turn the choiceſt myſtery of peace into a Sacrament of war, a feaſt of love into a bone of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This he did by diſorder in the primitive Church, <hi>1 Cor. 11.</hi> by Tranſubſtantiation in the Apoſtacy of the Church, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation in the Reſtitution of the Church; and now by a ſpirit of oppoſition againſt Sacramentall triall in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the managing of this unhappy Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
<pb facs="tcp:169758:4"/>Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> hath appeared three times in the field in his threefold Edition, pleading free admiſſion to the Lords Supper for all but three ſorts, against whom himſelf is pleaſed to ſhut the Chancell door, though the worſt of thoſe three kindes is better many times then ſundry of thoſe for whom he opens the door. Should we take the boldneſs to ask him, by what authority he excludes any from the Sacrament (it being in his profeſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a converting Ordinance) or by what rule of Scripture and charity he walks, in excluding the worſt from the means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, who need it more then the beſt, it would puzzle him more (and that upon good ground) then that captious Quaere of the Phariſees did our Saviour,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21.23. But whether the Lords Supper be a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance or not, Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> muſt needs be at a great loſs, for if it convert not, then why ſhould they receive it who are viſibly unconverted? If it do convert (as well as the Word preached) then why ſhould any at all be excluded from it?</p>
            <p>When this Anſwer was almoſt ready for the Preſs, out comes his third Edition, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<hi>auctior,</hi> but I dare not ſay <hi>correctior.</hi> This put me upon a review, and confirmed me in my opinion, that his Doctrine of free
<pb facs="tcp:169758:4"/>admiſſion is but meer Church-levelling, and will in a ſhort time make this glorious Church like the field of the Sluggard, <hi>Prov. 24.30, 31.</hi> When I ſeriouſly weigh his looſe Principles held forth to the world in this Treatiſe, with his being ſo exceſſively fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the looſer and profaner ſort, it makes both my ſelf and others apt to ſuſpect, his practiſes may poſſibly be as looſe as his principles. Looſe principles and practiſes, like <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah,</hi> taking each other by the heel, and ſtriving who ſhall come out firſt. Twins they are, and its hard to ſay which is the Elder brother.</p>
            <p>My ſcope in this Anſwer is (if God ſhall adde his bleſſing) 1. To convince Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> and others ſeduced by him, how contrary his Doctrine is to Scripture, reaſon, and his own profest principles. <hi>2.</hi> To prevent the further ſpreading of this leaven, which will ſowre the whole lump, and make Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (ſo much longed for, hoped for, and laboured for by the godly) to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate. Withall I muſt tell him, that this fancy of his (quite contrary to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of the reformed Churches, of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> even in the daies of the Prelates, to the expreſs letter of the Book of Common Prayer, to the declared
<pb facs="tcp:169758:5"/>judgement of the reverend Aſſembly, and to the Votes of Parliament unrepealed) hath exceedingly grieved the hearts of the godly, rejoyced and gladded the hearts of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hath done more miſchief already, then ten. Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> are ever like to do good. The Lord give him a ſight of his errour, and grace to burn this hay and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, before the day of the Lord come to try it, and himſelf for it, <hi>1 Cor. 3.13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One ſcruple yet untouched, which may haply ſtumble the Reader, I muſt not paſſe. What if a perſon by the previous exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (wherein the death of Chriſt is both audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and viſibly ſet forth) be really converted, may he not then actually partake of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and be admitted to receive by and with the Church? <hi>Anſw. 1.</hi> A perſon at firſt converſion ſees himſelf ſo loathſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, that he ſhall not need a bridle from, but rather a ſpur to the Sacrament. <hi>2.</hi> Its not enough for a perſon to be really clean, but he muſt alſo be judicially clean before he be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to communion, <hi>Levit.
14.1, 31.</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt cleanſed any, he ſtill ſent them to the Prieſt to pronounce them clean, <hi>Levit. 17.14. 3.</hi> However a man be really, the Church muſt proceed by the rule of viſibility, and cannot admit any till he be viſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169758:5"/>This is a doctrine cannot well down with ignorant and prophane perſons; it will be a stumbling blocks to the Iew, and fooliſhneſſe to the Greek; from whom I can expect no better entertainment then farre my betters have been content with before me.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe with thoſe golden though rowſing expreſſions of the Provinciall Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, in that excellent Piece of theirs, <hi>The Vindication of the Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> publiſhed <hi>Nov. 2. 1649. pag. 74.</hi> which book had Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſeriouſly peruſed, it might (through Gods bleſſing) have darted ſuch a beam of Majeſty into his conſcience, as would have quenched this <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of his, before it had miſled ſo many into bogs and quagmires. Their words are theſe: <hi>We are not ignorant that the Presbyterian Government</hi> (eſpecially as applied in order to Sacramentall triall)
<hi>hath many Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. The obſtinately ignorant hates it, becauſe it will not ſuffer him to go blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to hell. The profane perſon hates it, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ſe it will not ſuffer him to eat and drink his own damnation by unworthy coming to the Sacrament. The Heretick hates it, becauſe after two or three admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions it rejects him. The Jeſuite hates it, becauſe it is an invincible Bulwark to
<pb facs="tcp:169758:6"/>keep out Popery. The Schiſmatick hates it, becauſe the main deſign of it is to make all the Saints to be of one lip, one heart, and one way. And above all the Devil hates it, becauſe if rightly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it will in a ſhort time blow up his kingdome.</hi> Reader, let me but crave the favour Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Prefacer doth, that thou reade both this Anſwer and his Book <hi>with an impartiall and diſingaged judgement, peruſing both with a ſingle eye,</hi> and I am confident thou wilt neither be of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement nor practice, a ſtickler for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bounds, or removing the Land-mark ſet firſt by God himſelf, and afterwards by the Elders of our <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I leave it to thy ſerious peruſall, and both thee and it to Gods bleſsing, and remain,</p>

And if I may be free, I muſt ingenuouſly profeſs, I cannot but ſtumble at the very threſhold, eſpecially when I compare it with ſome parts of the Building. In the Title I ſee a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of humility, in the Book I reade many expreſſions that ſavour ſtrongly of pride.

            <p>And 1. That <hi>Judas</hi> received not the Lords Supper, theſe Arguments ſeem convincing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt knew him to be an hypocrite, a reprobate, and a devil, and ſo utterly uncapable of any good by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſts blood was ſhed for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſins who received the Lords Supper, compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. It was not ſhed for the remiſſion of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſins; <hi>Ergo, Judas</hi> did not

            <p n="3">3. Chriſt promiſed to drink wine in his Fathers Kingdome with thoſe who received the Lords Supper; He did not promiſe to drink wine with <hi>Judas</hi> in his Fathers Kingdome;
<hi>Ergo, Judas</hi> did not receive the Lords Supper. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Judas</hi> went out immediately after the Sop, <hi>John</hi> 13.30. This Sop was given him before the Sacrament; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was not at the Sacrament. Yea, from <hi>John</hi>

            <p n="5">5. All Chriſts gracious and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expreſſions to his Apoſtles, were allayed with exceptions while <hi>Judas</hi> was preſent, not ſo at and after the Lords Supper;

21, 24, 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 21, 22. It follows not then, that becauſe

            <p n="3">3. Chriſt acting here as a Miniſter, it was not fit he ſhould be both Judge and Witneſs, and it might have been an ill preſident for Miniſters to take upon them by their own power to deny the Sacrament judicially to whom they pleaſe. Its farre otherwiſe with us, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none are ſuſpended, but 1. Such as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169758:11"/>ſuſpend themſelves by ſlighting or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing due triall. 2. Such as upon triall are found unworthy through ignorance or ſcandall, and that onely till they gain better information, or give the Church juſt ſatisfaction. By all which it appears how weak Mr.
<hi>Humphreys</hi> firſt foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, and that therefore the ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture cannot be ſtrong. <hi>Contrà</hi> from his own proof we argue againſt him thus: None of the Apoſtles were either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or ſcandalous, no not <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, <hi>ergo,</hi> his or their receiving is no warrant for any ignorant or ſcandalous perſon to receive. The main queſtion is about <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and not as to ignorance, but ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall. And ſcandall cannot ariſe, but 1. From a ſin committed by a profeſſor. 2. Known and divulged. But
<hi>Iudas</hi> had not yet betrayed Chriſt, no more then <hi>Peter</hi> had denied him;
<hi>ergo,</hi> he was not yet convicted of a ſcandalous ſin. You will ſay <hi>Iudas</hi> had already done it in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and compact. <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, yet Chriſt charges him not with that, but onely foretels his actuall treachery, which being not yet perpetrated, was no viſible bar to his preſent receiving, but a ſad effect of his unworthy receiving
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169758:11"/>(ſuppoſing he did receive) the devil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into him as well after the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as after the Sop, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.27. Let all ignorant and ſcandalous perſons take heed of <hi>Iudas</hi> his ſin (unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) leſt the fate of <hi>Iudas</hi> betide them; namely, 1. Spirituall poſſeſſion by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. 2. Chriſt-murther. 3. Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>State the caſe aright, and a mean ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity may eaſily apprehend how wide and wilde Mr.
<hi>Humphrey</hi> his concluſion is, <hi>Iudas</hi> a great profeſſor, and an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and extraordinary Miniſter, plots and purpoſes a great ſin; that he ſhall commit this ſin, is foretold by a ſpirit of revelation, as alſo was <hi>Peters</hi> deniall and perjury. The queſtion is, Whether ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or both of them ſhall be ſuſpended the Sacrament. For my part, I think nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: 1. Becauſe thoſe ſins were not yet committed, and ſo not ſcandalous. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt acting as a Miniſter could not be both witneſs, judge, and executioner. If you ſay he acted as God or as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its very dangerous to make Chriſts Divine or Mediatory acts a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for imitation. Who will ſay, the Magiſtrate ſhould not condemn the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169758:12"/>adultreſs, becauſe Chriſt did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn her? <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.10, 11. Chriſt admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the Sacrament onely to men, onely to Miniſters, after ſupper, in ah upper room, muſt we therefore do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Whenever Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> preaches again upon this ſubject, let me intreat him to take a more pertinent Text, if at leaſt he can finde it; otherwiſe I muſt tell him, he will ſcarce prove himſelf (what he is ſtiled) a Maſter of Arts.</p>
            <p>But to paſs on. For the better mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his cauſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. Mr.
<hi>Humphrey</hi> premiſeth, <hi>That in the Church God hath ſet up his Ordinances of the Word and Sacrament. Of theſe Ordinances ſome are capable, and ſome uncapable. Thoſe that are uncapable, are either ſo by nature, as infants and diſtracted perſons, or by the Churches. Cenſure of Excommunication, and none others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we proceed, lets ſee what water ſome of theſe dictates will hold. And 1. How can he prove that Infants and diſtracted perſons are uncapable of the Sacrament by nature, eſpecially upon his own principles: for now I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute partly <hi>ad hominem</hi> and partly <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> and I doubt not but the judicious
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169758:12"/>Reader will eaſily reach me in both. I ſhall 1. inſtance in the word. Why are Infants and <hi>(pari ratione)</hi> diſtracted perſons uncapable of the Word? or where hath God ſaid they ſhould be kept from it, unleſs by their crying or unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geſtures they prove troubleſome to the Congregation? I can ſhew him the contrary, where God would have them preſent at the Word and Ordinances. Let him conſult <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.11, 12. &amp; 31.12.
<hi>Ioſh.</hi> 8.35. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.16. &amp; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.13. and that to enter into Covenant, &amp;c. as is evident in ſome of the places quoted, eſpecially the two firſt. If God bids them come, why ſhould Maſter <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſay they are uncapable? 2. Suppoſe them uncapable, yet who knows how God may work at the Word, though not by the Word? May not that Word be an occaſion of converſion to Infants, which is an inſtrument of converſion to elder perſons?</p>
            <p>Infants indeed may be uncapable in an active, but not in a paſſive ſenſe; as to apprehenſion and underſtanding, not as to Divine Impreſſions. God can work upon perſons at or by his Ordinances, occaſionally or inſtrumentally, when he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169758:13"/>is honoured by their active or paſſive preſentation before him, which may be the caſe of blinde and deaf perſons, as well as of Infants and innocents, and upon which account (as well as out of a deſire to honour God) ſome pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have thought it their duty to attend upon the publick Miniſtry, though they were deaf. Why ſhould not I believe that Chriſt is willing to ſpeak immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to him that loves to be where Chriſt ſpeaks mediately? If men can ſpeak by ſignes as well as words, ſure Chriſt can much more ſpeak by his Spirit to ſuch deaf perſons. If ſome in hearing do not hear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. why may not others hear in not hearing? An hearing heart is better then an hearing ear. More might be added, but I muſt contract.</p>
            <p>Next, for the Lords Supper. Suppoſing that Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is for Paedobaptiſme. I ask him in the next place, Why are Infants capable of Baptiſme, and not of the Lords Supper? If he ſay, Becauſe they cannot examine themſelves, nor diſcern the Lords Body, &amp;c. Then I anſwer, No more can groſly ignorant perſons; who therefore <hi>(pari ratione)</hi> upon Mr.
<hi>Humphrey</hi> his principles, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169758:13"/>according to truth, muſt be kept away: but that they cannot be unleſs diſcerned, nor can they be diſcerned unleſs tried; and who have more authority to try them, then ſuch as are over them in the Lord, and delegated for that purpoſe both by God and man?</p>
            <p>Further, that perſons excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are uncapable of the Word preached. How proves he that? Upon this account I dare challenge him and all the world for one proof of Scripture, either direct or by conſequence. An excommunicate perſon is but as an heathen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. and heathens might be admitted to hear, why then not excommunicated perſons, they needing that effectuall means of converſion as much or more then Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Whereas in the cloſe he adds, <hi>That none others are uncapable;</hi> and ſo by conſequence none others ought to be kept away, What thinks he 1. of perſons infected with the plague, &amp;c. 2. What thinks he of perſons ſtark ſtaring drunk, or that with <hi>Zimry</hi> and <hi>Coſby</hi> ſhall commit actuall uncleanneſs in the face of the Congregation, and the like? will Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> proſtitute the Sacrament
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169758:14"/>to the luſts of ſuch bruits and ſwine? For ſhame then let him not plead that all muſt be admitted but infants, mad men, and excommunicated perſons.</p>
            <p>In the ſame page, I wonder Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is ſo diffident where he may be confident. His words are theſe, <hi>I dare not yet poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſay, for the peoples part, that all are ſo capable that they may come as they liſt.</hi> For my own part, I aſſent to it as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, that none are ſo capable that they may come as they liſt. How doth this man ſtrain at a gnat, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Camel; ſtumble at a ſtraw, and leap over a block? doubts an evident truth, and pleads ſtrongly for a looſe and undoubted errour, that all may be admitted pell mell. How juſt is it with God, that he who is confident where he ſhould be diffident, ſhould alſo be diffident where he ought to be confident?</p>
            <p>He aſſerts,<note place="margin">Page 4.</note> 
               <hi>Such an univerſall capacity for all men indefinitely, that if any come in as profeſſing themſelves ready to enter into covenant with Chriſt, deſiring to ſerve him in the worſhip of this Ordinance (the former onely excepted) the Miniſter and Church ought to admit him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From this Conceſſion ler me be bold
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169758:14"/>to ask Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> before whom ſhall they make this profeſſion? If before the Miniſter and the Church (as he ſeems to hint) then may not the Miniſter before the Church deſire ſome evidence of the ſincerity of this their profeſſion? If not, then let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhew where he is forbid to make this ſcrutiny. If he may, then undoubtedly he may try that profeſſor as to his knowledge and grace; and do we deſire any more? nay not ſo much. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> perſwade the people but to make this profeſſion before the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (we deſire not to put their modeſty to it before the Congregation) and we ſhall either admit them at preſent, or undertake to fit them (by Gods grace) for the Sacrament, before we have done with them, if at leaſt they will but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be ruled by us.</p>
            <p>If he mean, that the Miniſter muſt reſt in that verball profeſſion, without any further ſcrutiny, then why may not a childe of three yeers old, or a mad man be admitted, ſince they may eaſily be taught the words of that profeſſion? Further, doth Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> admit none but ſuch as make this profeſſion? Here I appeal to his own conscience, and to his Congregation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:169758:15"/>If yet he fly from a verball to a virtuall profeſſion, and think their very coming or ſending their names to their Miniſter over night, &amp;c. be ſufficient, eſpecially if betake this courſe with ſtrangers alſo, then how doth he know whether they be Chriſtians or heathen, ſober or diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, children or elder perſons, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated or members of the Church.

               </label> 1. Its well he corrects himſelf from <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. whereby it appears there was not a free admiſſion to the Paſſeover, and then where is his argument? If he plead, that onely legall uncleanneſs excluded them, I ask him why? He will anſwer, becauſe it defiled the Congregation, or the Ordinances and holy things, or both. Content. But what if it be proved that not onely Leviticall, but alſo morall uncleanneſs defiled the holy things, and that therefore ſuch perſons alſo were to be kept away. For proof hereof, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<hi>Levit.</hi> 18.24, 25. Morall pollutions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169758:15"/>defiled firſt the perſon, and then the Land, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.16. They defiled the Sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. <hi>verſe</hi> 37, 39. Adulterers and Murderers, and Idolaters, coming reak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their ſins into Gods Houſe, defiled the Sanctuary thereby,
<hi>Hag.</hi> 2.14. For neglecting to build Gods Temple; themſelves, their actions and their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were unclean; and though the Temple were typicall and ceremoniall, yet their neglecting to build it at Gods command, was a direct breach of the ſecond Commandment, and therefore a ſin, or morall pollution. And that all unclean perſons were to be ſuſpended, is evident by
2 Chron. 23.19. <hi>Where Iehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah is commended for ſetting porters at the gates of the Houſe of the Lord, that none which were unclean in any thing ſhould enter in.</hi> The Lord ſend us many ſuch <hi>Ichojada</hi>'s. Where then were Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his eyes, who aſſerts ſo confidently page 5. <hi>But as for any ſpirituall pollution whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we reade of none that might debar them from that Ordinance.</hi> Did he not reade, or did he not minde, or did he not underſtand, or did he not remember any of the forementioned places? for I will not be ſo uncharitable as to conclude he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169758:16"/>never read over the old Teſtament, or that againſt his conſcience he delivered the forementioned words, or that he quibbled and equivocated upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Tenſe for the preter Tenſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the inſtance of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Paſſover, ſhews that morall uncleanneſs made them more unworthy of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver then Leviticall uncleanneſs; the Lord then accepting the upright heart, <hi>though not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary,</hi> 2
<hi>Ch.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ground upon this inſtance of the Paſſover, then not onely elder perſons, but alſo Infants muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lords Supper, for Infants were admitted to the Paſſover, ſince all circumciſed perſons were to eat thereof; and if ſo, then where is his firſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that makes Infants uncapable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wherea <hi>pag.</hi> 5. he makes the ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of unclean perſons a type of our excommunication. He muſt excuſe me if I believe not his bare dilates without proof. I thought legall types had reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Evangelicall graces, or ſpirituall uncleanneſſes, but not Evangelicall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, unleſs Chriſt, the onely great and effectuall Ordinance. Further, had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169758:16"/>they not the Ordinance of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation amongſt them as well as we, and why ſhould that be typified which was viſibly preſent? And here by the way let me ask Maſter <hi>Humphrey,</hi> whether amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> an excommunicated perſon might have been admitted to the Paſſover? That they had Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is evident <hi>John</hi>
9.22, 34 &amp; 12.42. &amp; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. and that by the rules of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſuch were neither to be eat nor drunk with. Further, that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication was not for Leviticall pollutions, but ſcandalous ſins; and in particular, that not onely Leviticall pollutions, but alſo ſcandalous ſins were a barre to the receiving of the Paſſeover. Contrary to Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> his Aſſertion above mentioned.</p>
            <p>For clearing whereof conſider, that there were 3 degrees of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt the Jews: A perſon excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in the firſt degree, was called <hi>Niddui,</hi> ſeparated or caſt out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.22. The ſecond, <hi>Cherem,</hi> or delivered up to Satan, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. The third, <hi>Schammatha,</hi> or
<hi>Maranatha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22.</p>
            <p>In the Greek Church there were four degrees of Excommunication. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169758:17"/>ſuch were onely barred the Lords Table. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuch might hear onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Pulpit, and muſt depart with the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> &amp;c. 3.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuch might come no further then the Church porch, and might not joyn in Prayer, &amp;c. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſuch ſtood quite without the Church, requeſting others with tears to pray for them, and thence they were called <hi>plorantes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it appears, 1. That Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion is no new invention, but if juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically iſſued forth, was a degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; which being in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement a barre to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he muſt needs grant Suſpenſion to be a barre to receiving, unleſs he will contradict both the truth and himſelf. 2. Its evident, that Excommunication is not a barre to preſence at all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſince all the four degrees of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated perſons amongſt the Greeks might partake of ſome Ordinances, at leaſt without the Church. And <hi>Niddui</hi> amongſt the Jews <hi>might be preſent at Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, to teach others, and learn of others, though he might not come neer any the distance of four cubits,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Its evident, that Excommunication was not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169758:17"/>for Leviticall but morall pollutions (at leaſt in the apprehenſion of thoſe who excommunicated) 1. By Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 17. where obſtinacy in ſin is made a juſt ground of excommunication, <hi>If thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 34. &amp; 12.42. they looked at the confeſſion of Jeſus as Chriſt, as a ſin that deſerved excommunication; which though a groſs and dangerous miſtake, yet evinceth that morall pollution was with them the ground of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 2. Excommunication being a Church-cenſure, had onely ſin for its object; nor did a leprous man more deſerve excommunication with them, then a plaguy man doth with us. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is the key of Diſcipline, to ſhut out of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. a bond to retain ſin; compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. with <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.23. a thunderclap, not againſt naturall infirmities, but ſinfull enormities. Indeed perſons Levitically polluted, might for preſent be materially excommunicated, as being ſeparated or ſhut without the Camp for fear of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, and ſo are plaguy perſons with us; but this is as far from formall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, as a dead body is from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169758:18"/>a living man. 3. Its evident by the practice of the Jews, amongſt whom the firſt degree of Excommunication, called <hi>Niddui,</hi> laſted for thirty daies, unleſs it were ſhortened by repentance; but onely ſin is the object of repentance, and not a bloudy iſſue, or other Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call pollutions. See <hi>Buxtorf, Budaeus, Godwin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Its evident that this firſt degree of Excommunication,<note place="margin">See
<hi>Aarous Rod bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming,</hi> l. 1. c. 9. &amp; 10. &amp; 12.</note> called <hi>Niddui,</hi> was a barre in particular to the Paſſeover (which anſwers our Lords Supper) ſince it
<hi>ſignified a ſeparation from all commerce with any man or woman for the diſtance of four cubits, and particularly from eating or drinking with any.</hi> And hence probably flowed that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>With ſuch a one no not to eat.</hi> Which is as extendable with us to our Sacramentall eating, as it was with the Jews. I might bring as a proof of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. which is a cutting off from the Church of God, and that not for Leviticall pollutions, but for wilfull omiſſions or commiſſions. See
<hi>Mercer</hi> upon the place.</p>
            <p>His Argument then from <hi>the elder Brother the Paſſeover,</hi> is like <hi>Reuben,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:169758:18"/>unſtable as water. Let us ſee whether he can draw a ſtronger argument from <hi>the younger brother our Sacrament</hi> (as he is pleaſed to tearm it.)</p>
            <p>His firſt proof is from 1 Cor. 10.17. <hi>We being many, are all partakers of one bread.</hi> Thence he concludes, <hi>That divers of the Corinthians were ready to go to Idols.</hi> verſe 14.
<hi>yet all were admitted to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
            </p>

               </label> 1. The dehortation doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prove they were Idolaters, though indeed too many of them, eſpecially the ſtronger Chriſtians, abuſed their liberty in eating things ſacrificed to Idols, to the offence of their weaker brethren, and ſometimes (which was more ſcandalous) in the Idols Temple: this they did as apprehending the thing was indifferent; and by uſing their utmoſt liberty, went beyond the bounds, judging any place of eating lawfull (and that without weighing circumſtances) as well as any meats lawfull, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. This, though bad, was not (eſpecially before ſufficient admonition given) a juſt barre to their receiving.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet taking it for granted, many of them were guilty of greater ſins, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169758:19"/>pears by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21. How proves he from the place, that all theſe were notwithſtanding admitted. As all Jews might eat the Paſſeover, ſo all Church Members might receive the Lords Supper. All circumciſed perſons had a right to the Paſſeover, yet ſome of them might not injoy it at all times,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 9.7. So all baptized perſons have a right to the Lords Supper, yet may not alwaies actually uſe this their right; nay not all true converts neither, till they be worthy actually as well as habitually. A perſon may be capable <hi>in actu primo,</hi> yet not <hi>in actu ſecundo.</hi> All the Prieſts had a right to the holy things, yet were not permitted at any time to make uſe of that right, <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.2, 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſing all did receive it promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, how proves he from this place, that the Apoſtle did allow that free admiſſion? doth the drawing an argument from practice, allow that practice? Then by arguing from baptizing for the dead, the Apoſtle ſhould allow baptizing for the dead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. From their actuall communicating the Apoſtle proves they were one body; and ſecondly, That they ought not to communicate with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169758:19"/>Idols. Doth this manner of arguing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily juſtifie their admitting all to communicate pell mell at any time?</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>pag.</hi> 7. he urges, <hi>That they were drunken together at the Lords Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> 1. Then it ſeems they were not drunk before, but at the Table; and how can that be a let to receiving which was cauſed by receiving, unleſs he will make the Effect an impediment to the Cauſe, the Conſequent to the Antecedent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But granting this drunkenneſs were at their love Feaſts, which preceded the Lords Supper, I anſwer, Its more then Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can prove, that they were drunken in the ordinary and ſtrict ſenſe, ſince in Scripture phraſe the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and
<hi>Shachar</hi> ſignifie, though liberall drinking, yet within the bounds of temperance, as is evident, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.34. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. And the Apoſtle reproves them rather for diſorder and uncharitableneſs, then for exceſs; that they ſtayed not for their Brethren, whereby the rich fed and drunk liberally when the poor were hungry and thirſty. Compare <hi>ver.</hi> 22. &amp;c 33. 3. What Logick is in this conſequence (ſuppoſing they were drunk indeed?) Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reproves them for coming drunk to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169758:20"/>Sacrament; <hi>ergo,</hi> they ought to come to the Sacrament, even though they be drunk. Is not the quite contrary more rationall, St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved them for coming when drunk to the Sacrament; <hi>ergo,</hi> they ought not to come when drunk to the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>His next proof is from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. By the way, where he ſaies, <hi>They were all admitted freely to our Sacrament.</hi> He ſpeaks <hi>gratis.</hi> Indeed, if he ſpeak as to the thing ſignified, undoubtedly their and our Sacraments are all one, and thus even Circumciſion and the Paſſeover were the ſame with our Baptiſme and the Lords Supper; but as to the outward elements, I think there's a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between their Manna and our Bread, their Water out of the rock, and our Wine, But for the thing it ſelf, if he will make that a preſident for free admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then unbaptized perſons, yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſtracted, Infants, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated perſons, by this rule may partake of the Lords Supper, as there uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed perſons, &amp;c. did partake of thoſe Sacraments. Yea, many who were born after their paſſing the Sea, and ſo not baptized neither, yet ate of the Manna,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169758:20"/>and drank of the rocks. Witneſs 1. The mixed multitude that went out of
<hi>Egypt</hi> with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.38. 2. Many of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves who were uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in the wilderneſs, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.5. yet did eat of the Manna and drank of the rock.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their partaking univerſally of that Sacramentall Meat and Drink, is no argument for our free admiſſion, till Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can make out as great a neceſſity for our univerſall receiving as for theirs; namely, that all who receive not, muſt both ſtarve and choak, that Sacramentall Bread and Water being their daily and neceſſary repaſt. Nor will Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> evade this anſwer by his parallels <hi>pag.</hi> 8. which do not run on four feet, as we ſay. And however their Sacraments and ours, their condition and ours may agree in divers reſpects; and it be very true, that God is not well pleaſed with many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers amongſt us, no more then amongſt them; yet herein is a manifeſt difference, that their Sacramentall Elements had a double uſe and end; namely, to nouriſh their bodies as well as their ſoules; nor had they ordinarily in the Wilderneſs other food to live upon, and therefore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169758:21"/>they muſt either receive thoſe Sacraments or die. I hope there is not ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of our Sacramentall Bread and Wine. Had God made our daily food (as he did to them) a Sacrament, I ſay then it were cruelty and murder to deny any man the Sacrament, and then not onely monthly, but alſo weekly, yea daily Sacraments had been neceſſary: but that muſt have been by accident, not from the nature of a Sacrament.</p>
            <p>His next Argument is drawn from the generall invitation to the Marriage Feaſt,<note place="margin">Page 9.</note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 22, &amp; <hi>Luke</hi> 14.</p>

Now the queſtion is not, Whether all ought to come to the Feaſt? but, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all muſt eat of the Feaſt in the Diſh of the Sacrament, as well as of the Word?

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Since the main ſcope of the parable is to hold forth the rejecting of the Jews and calling of the Gentiles (which is the

            <p n="4">4. If this be meant particularly of the Lords Supper, then let me ask Mr. <hi>H.</hi> whether ſome worldly occaſions may not juſtly excuſe our abſence? and whether all are judged there unworthy, who are ſometimes kept from the Lords Supper by their worldly occaſions? The weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt occaſions cannot excuſe any from the Marriage Feaſt. But I think Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> will not deny, but ſome worldly occaſions may excuſe a man from the Sacrament, as is evident by analogy, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.10.</p>
            <p>More might be added to ſhew the weakneſs of his plea from theſe parables. But whereas he addes <hi>pag.</hi> 10. <hi>Now who is that faithfull ſteward, that gives the houſhold their portion of meat in due ſeaſon,

For 1. What an eaſie matter is it to be a faithfull ſteward, if this faithfulneſs lie in admitting all pell mell to the Sacrament. 2. Will it not follow by this rule, that the profaneſt Miniſters, who are moſt for free admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are the moſt faithfull ſtewards. 3.

            <p n="2">2. Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſhew me the force of this conſequence, <hi>Peter</hi> was commanded to converſe with a godly man, though levitically unclean (as not being circumciſed and a proſelyte) which uncleanneſs after the death of Chriſt was taken away; <hi>Ergo, Paul</hi> ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with a profane Chriſtian that is morally unclean. How ſutable this is to Scripture, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. Further, <hi>Peter</hi> is commanded to preach the Word to Heathen, that were comers on, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169758:23"/>ready to receive it; <hi>ergo, Paul</hi> may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament to all ignorant and wicked Chriſtians that reject Chriſt and his Word.

            <p n="4">4. That by excluding excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſons from the Word preached, he runs into an uncharitable and dangerous errour, hath been formerly proved, which I will not here repeat. Much more might be added, had I leaſure to follow him in his wild-gooſe-chace. I think he may well be accounted a Maſter of Arts at wreſting the Scripture; and whether he hath writ more words or errours, ſeems to me a diſputable point.</p>
            <p>For a further flouriſh, in the ſame Page he heaps up Texts of Scripture that hold forth the offers of free grace to all, which make as much for free admiſſion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169758:24"/>to the ſeal of this Sacrament, as an offer of pardon to all rebels, proves, that even thoſe rebels muſt have their pardons ſealed who ſtand out againſt their Prince, as well as thoſe that come in and ſubmit upon pardon offered. Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> and all the world know, that we deſire to keep none from the ſeal, who will pleaſe to make it out to us, that (but in the judgement of charity) they have a right to the thing ſignified. Which may ſerve to take away that wonder of his, <hi>How we can have the conſcience to turn them away from the ſignes and means of grace in this Ordinance, to whom the Goſpel offers Chriſt freely.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Not generall offers of Chriſt, but our actuall receiving of him viſibly, is the rule of admiſſion to the Sacrament.

            <p>His firſt Argument is, <hi>The Sacraments are</hi> verbum viſibile, <hi>a viſible Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore the ſame latitude muſt be granted to them both</hi> (meaning the Word preached and the Sacrament) <hi>in their adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And here he triumphs (poor man) before the victory, in theſe words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following, <hi>Vpon this ground, me thinks, I ſtand as upon a rock, againſt which all objections, like waves, do but daſh themſelves in pieces.</hi>

               </label> 1. If the Sacrament have the ſame lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the Word, then a Turk or Heathen may receive as well as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; but this is contrary to Mr.
<hi>Humphrey</hi> his profeſſed principles, as well as to the truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His conſequence will not hold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he can prove that <hi>verbum viſibile</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts as well as <hi>verbum audibile,</hi> and that it was inſtituted for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though it ſhould convert, it proves onely that all ſhould be preſent, not that all ſhould receive.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:169758:25"/>4. Granting his foundation, I retort it upon himſelf. As the Word preached is applicable to all, ſo alſo the Sacraments; But the Word preached is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately applicable to all; I mean as to that part of its gracious offer which is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly tendered and ſealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For inſtance, there are ſome righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſons (in their own conceit) that Chriſt came not to call. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.13. many ſelf-juſtitiaries and conceited
<hi>Laodiceans,</hi> to whom in that condition mercy is not immediately applicable; But to whom
<hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> the Covenant is not applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to them the ſeales of it are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable; and where ſuch may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their groſs ignorance or ſcandall, they are viſibly as well as really unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and ſhould not be permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, where there is a juſt Authority to exclude them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To come a little cloſer to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> As the Word preached may be heard by all, yet cannot be applied to all in divers things, ſo the word <hi>viſible</hi> (the Lords Supper) may be ſeen by all, but ought not to be applied to all in divers caſes; namely, when that which is ſealed in the Sacrament is not immediately appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169758:25"/>to them by the Word, for the Word and Sacrament muſt go hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Ergo,</hi> where the covenant of grace is not viſibly applicable, there the viſible ſign of that covenant is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. But the covenant of grace is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unapplicable to many perſons in the boſome of the viſible Church; <hi>ergo.</hi> And thus Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> his rock proves but a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and his viſible Word makes againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>His amplification from <hi>pag.</hi> 11. to the 15. is as impertinent as his Argument is weak. We eaſily grant, the Lords Supper declares the covenant of grace as a ſign, and ratifies it as a ſeal; but that its there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be applied to all, is a meer <hi>non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur.</hi> Indeed where grace is freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by an audible word, all may, yea and ſhould hear it; and where its offered by a viſible word, all have liberty to ſee it, and ſo may be preſent at the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Lords Supper, as well as at preaching and Baptiſme: But that all ought actually to partake (be they in what ſtate they will, unleſs uncapable by age, dotage, or excommunication) is a new light ſtarted by Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> which like an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> will lead thouſands
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169758:26"/>into utter darkneſs. Had Mr. <hi>H.</hi> either read or underſtood our meaning (as eaſily he might, had he pleaſed, by what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in print in a firſt and ſecond diſcourſe by the Antiquaeriſt) he would not have ſhot ſo wide at rovers as now he doth. The hinge of the controverſie turns not upon this point, Whether all may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when the covenant of grace is ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, offered, and ſealed in the Sacrament, but whether all preſent may actually partake thereof; and in particular thoſe who viſibly reject the covenant of grace that is ſigned, offered, and ſealed by it. To keep to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his own ſimilitude, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. A generall pardon ſent by a Prince, may be offered to all Rebels within his Dominion, all of them may hear the pardon read, and if need be, ſee it ſealed; upon which ſome come in and ſubmit really, others profeſſedly ſtand out againſt pardon offered; a third ſort ſeemingly ſubmit, yet ſecretly carry about them daggers or poyſon to murder their Prince. The King knows this, and his Ambaſſadours ſtrongly ſuſpect it. Now I ask Mr. <hi>H.</hi> 1. Whether pardon ſhall be ſealed particularly to them that openly ſtand it out? 2. Whether the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169758:26"/>Ambaſſadours ought not to try all that ſubmit, that it may appear who ſubmit really and who treacherouſly; and the latter being found out, is Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> of the minde that pardon ſhould parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly be ſealed to them, as well as to thoſe who ſubmit really? If ſo, I think he is a better friend to Traytors then to good Subjects or good Government. Apply this caſe to the Lords Supper, and it will quickly put an end to this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, now again unhappily raiſed by Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> to the no ſmall joy of profane and ignorant perſons, and grief of Gods people. Every Sacrament ſeals, 1. The truth of the covenant of grace. 2. Its generall offer. 3. By ſome of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall actions it doth inſtrumentally apply the Covenant to every worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and to none elſe. Now (if Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> and other diſſenters will pleaſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand us aright) all may ſee the truth of the Covenant of Grace, and its generall offer ſealed, and ſo may be preſent at the whole adminiſtration, which is made up of ſeverall Ordinances, the ſight and hearing whereof may be very profitable for all ſorts. But that the Covenant of Grace ſhould be inſtrumentally applied,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169758:27"/>
               <hi>per ſigilla,</hi> to all ſorts, is in a manner as bad as if it ſhould be applied to them by word of mouth, and haply in ſome ſenſe worſe. Dares Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſay to any perſon viſibly in the ſtate of nature, Sir, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that Chriſt and all the benefits of the Covenant of Grace are actually and for ever yours? And will he dare to ſeal that which he dares not ſay? The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of every actuall giving is. Chriſt is thine in particular, and of every actuall receiving is, Chriſt is mine in particular. And ſhall any Miniſter dare ſolemnly to deceive any ſelf-deceiving perſon, and confirm him in preſumption, to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of his ſoul, when he may regularly prevent that miſchief? If this be not a ſtrengthening of the hands of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22. I beſeech you what is?</p>
            <p>To anſwer therefore briefly to his four Conſiderations, held forth by way of concluſion,
<hi>pag.</hi> 15.16. &amp; 17. To the firſt I anſwer, Thoſe whom we would not baptize, bad they been to have been baptized at yeers of diſcretion, thoſe we cannot admit to the Lords Supper, though baptized in their infancy. And I ask Mr. <hi>H.</hi> whether there be not many ſuch in <hi>England,</hi> who yet are neither
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169758:27"/>children, nor fools, nor excommunicated? And here let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> remember his own rule, p. 10. <hi>Adultis cadem eſt ratio utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque Sacramenti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſecond. The queſtion is not about the freeneſs of the offer, but about the freeneſs of acceptance; and whether they who viſibly reject grace freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, ought to be admitted to the ſign and ſeal of that grace. And here let me ask Mr. <hi>H.</hi> again, whether his conſcience did not check him for aſperſing us with that ſoul ſlander, <hi>pag.</hi>
16. <hi>That we admit none but ſuch as are qualified to our own minde.</hi> Doth not Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> know that we plead not onely the Word of God (which is abundantly enough) but alſo the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament, for what we do in this point; by whoſe Ordinance, not repealed, we are civilly inabled to do what we do; and have alſo from them (after mature deliberation with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Divines) a rule to walk by, againſt which if we tranſgreſs, we are accountable to the civill Magiſtrate; and dares he notwithſtanding charge us with admittance of none but ſuch as are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to our minde? Or, 2. That in thus doing, <hi>we will not let people come without
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169758:28"/>their price and money to this Ordinance?</hi> Do godly Parents and Maſters, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their children and ſervants from the Sacrament till they be ſufficiently inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the main grounds of Religion, do they, I ſay, in this pious act put them upon it, not to come to the Lords Supper, till they can bring their price and money to this Ordinance? and yet ſhall godly Miniſters and Elders, who are ſpirituall parents, and alſo ſpecially inabled by the Magiſtrate, a civil Parent, to do the like, be judged (by one ſcarce out of the ſhell, either in Learning or Divinity) as if they were all the children of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and drove a bargain of Chriſt and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for money, becauſe they are carefull that perſons viſibly unqualified, and who think to purchaſe Chriſt and grace for money, may not have either him or it upon ſuch baſe tearms? 3. Is he not yet more aſhamed, in the ſame page to affirm, <hi>Why this is even as they conceive of</hi> Judas, <hi>who being about to ſell our Saviour, went out to make his bargain at the Supper.</hi> It ſeems, if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> may be judge, 1. We are a company of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſes.</hi> 2. We betray Chriſt, becauſe we will not ſuffer others to murder him.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169758:28"/>3. We drive a bargain for the buying and ſelling of Chriſt, becauſe we uſe a rod made by Chriſt and publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to whip the buyers and ſellers out of Gods Temple. Thus in the judgement of greater and wiſer men then Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Chriſt was an enemy to <hi>Caeſar, Paul</hi> a ſeditious fellow, &amp;c. The very mention of this ſlander is enough to refute it. I ſay no more, but the Lord rebuke and forgive the Authour of it.</p>
            <p>To his third Conſideration I anſwer, 1. Its very dubitable, whether full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction be enough to converſion; yea, the ſtronger conviction is in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the higher doth the will and affections riſe againſt it (if not conquered and ſanctified by grace,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, 9.) yea to the commiſſion of the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That by application of the ſeal, the meſſage of reconciliation comes in its full vertue, for the working this conviction and faith unto ſalvation,</hi> is both a groſs and implicated errour, as hath in part been formerly proved. For 1. Conviction of the truth and generall offer of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant comes not by the Sacrament, as ſealing and applying to perſons (which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169758:29"/>rather conduceth to the faith of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar evidence) but as ſignifying and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt to all, who therefore may with great profit be preſent at the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. 2. Conviction that Chriſt is mine in particular, cannot be wrought by actuall receiving in any but the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver, and ſuch is no ignorant perſon, or any that lives and lies in a known ſin, who therefore cannot receive but to his own prejudice, nor by Church-officers be admitted to receive (if viſibly ſo) without their prejudice alſo, who ſuffer him to contract the guilt of Chriſts body and blood, to eat and drink judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf, and to do an act that cannot either convert or edifie him <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> but aggravate his ſin and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as hereafter (by Gods aſſiſtance) ſhall more fully appear.</p>
            <p>Before I paſs to his fourth conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there lies in the way one objection which is worth the anſwering, which ſeems to croſs our former aſſertion.</p>

               </label> Suppoſing the objection were true; actuall giving and receiving, ſeals either Chriſt or judgement to every Receiver, and he that eats and drinks not Chriſt, eats and drinks judgement to himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In its own nature and primary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention it ſeals Chriſt and mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Miniſter in his acting <hi>ex officio,</hi> applies mercy
<hi>charitativè</hi> to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers who are viſibly worthy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When therefore the Miniſter ſees any preſent who are viſibly unworthy, if he he inabled by judiciall power, he muſt not permit him to receive: if not (as it falls out where no Presbytery is ſettled) he muſt either perſwade ſuch a perſon to forbear, or elſe in plain tearms tell him the danger of his unworthy receiving, and that he will prove a murderer of Chriſt, as our Saviour did unto <hi>Judas:</hi> by which forewarning, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive where Church-Government is not ſettled, the Miniſter may clear his own ſoul, as having not power of himſelf to admit or keep back without judiciall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169758:30"/>proceſs, wherein himſelf cannot be both judge and witneſs, And thus both word and ſeal go together, and aſſure particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mercy or judgement to Receivers, as they are worthy or unworthy; as the Prieſts word went along with the bitter water, to do the honeſt woman good, but the adultreſs hurt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.19, 22, 27, 29. <hi>Contra,</hi> though the Word make moſt worſe, yet it makes very many bad ones good: but the Sacrament makes onely good ones better.</p>

               </label> He may poſſibly ſeal to an untruth, but doth not ſeal to a lie, as admitting that perſon whom in charity (being approved upon due triall) he may and ought to judge worthy: As I may ſpeak comfort to one whom I judge to be in the ſtate of grace, yet may very eaſily be miſtaken about his condition. 2. If the Miniſter notwithſtanding ſuſpect a perſon, though legally approved, he may and ought the more carefully to warn him to look to it he be what he profeſſes himſelf to be, leſt otherwiſe for all mans approbation, he eat and drink judgement to himſelf. And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169758:30"/>by this means I conceive he may clear himſelf, but cannot keep back him that is approved by the major vote of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip: onely afterwards hath power to appeal to the Claſſis, in caſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Elderſhip prevaricate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to admit unworthy ones out of by-reſpects; as they likewiſe may do of the Miniſter. But all this doth not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the admiſſion of any who may be regularly ſuſpended, no more then of him who is to be excommunicated, but is not, through corruption of the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>For his fourth Conſideration,<note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> we grant the Goſpel is the Goſpel of peace, &amp;c. yet its as true, that whereever it comes it occaſions war; not of its own nature, but by means of humane corruption, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34, 35. and that by means of ſeparation which it makes whereever it comes. And is it any wonder then, that the ſeals of this Goſpel by making ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, make alſo diviſion? Where the promiſes are not applicable ſo much as viſibly, there ſure the ſeals of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are not applicable; the deniall whereof yet muſt needs vex hypocrites, who by this means are pried into, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169758:31"/>uncaſed, as a ſoul-ſearching Miniſtry doth; and no wonder then if the devil of contention be conjured up, and Gods <hi>Jeremies,</hi> who ſeparate the precious from the vile, be men of contention to the whole Earth. <hi>Cain</hi> will be angry if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> finde better acceptance then himſelf; and hypocrites, who care leaſt for reall goodneſs, yet are very ambitious of all the priviledges of piety, and proclaim war againſt ſuch as deny them, though never ſo juſtly, (as the Phariſees did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Saviour) but I pray who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve blame for this contention, Gods faithfull Miniſters or hypocrites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who by viſible unworthineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of thoſe priviledges, and yet malign Chriſts Stewards, who dare not be ſo laviſh and prodigall of their Maſters proviſions as theſe perſons would have them. What therefore he adds by way of rhetoricall amplification is frivolous as to his purpoſe, ſince none are Saints but ſuch ſinners, and none to be approved for Saints by the Church, but ſuch as acknowledge themſelves great ſinners.

If he can prove it is againſt Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and decency, to admit to the Lords Supper a perſon viſibly worthy, though unbaptized, I will eaſily prove its more againſt order and decency to admit to the Lords Supper a perſon viſibly unworthy, though baptized. Had
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary, I ſhould rather have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the former to receive, when unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, then the latter, though baptized.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whatever Mr. <hi>H.</hi> inſinuates in the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169758:32"/>cloſe of his Proviſion, we are as much both for Order and for the Ordinances as himſelf; and could not the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be had without diſorder, we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpence with Order, then part with the Ordinances. The difference then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us is this, We plead for, and (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) injoy the Lords Supper with order and decency; Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pleads for it, and injoyes it with diſorder and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whatever he pretends in his Proviſion to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His ſecond Argument he draws from the nature of the viſible Church; which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines or deſcribes to be a number of ſuch as make profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo are Saints by calling, whatever they are in truth. The eſſentiall marks whereof (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſubſists as viſible) is the preaching of the Word, and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now unleſs men will be ſo bold as to diveſt our mixed Congregations</hi> (<hi>and ſo conſequently all</hi> England <hi>formerly</hi>) <hi>of the name of the viſible Church, they cannot take from us one of its eſſentiall notes, in the free uſe of this Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
               </label> 1. His deſcription is liable enough to exception, ſince a viſible Church ſtrictly is not a bare number of Profeſſors, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169758:32"/>of ſuch as combine for Church ends. The Church is a Corporation, and not members as ſo, make a body, but as united either by virtuall or actuall conſent, &amp;c. and that either in their diſtinct Societies, which we call Pariſhes or particular Congregations, or in their Repreſentees and Officers delegated for the publick concernment of particular Churches, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Claſſis, Province, Nation, divers Nations, or the whole world, whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe Claſſicall, Provinciall, Nationall, or Oecumenicall Aſſemblies, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing this to be his meaning, though not ſo clearly expreſſed,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ask him in the next place, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Profeſſors or Saints by calling, are
<hi>eo nomine</hi> to be admitted to the Lords Supper; if ſo, then why doth he ſhut out children and diſtracted perſons, who are as truly Saints by calling, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors as others. Its apparent then that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion is not the ultimate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of admiſſion, unleſs accompanied with ſutable knowledge and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at leaſt viſibly; and that groſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance appearing, or a ſcandalous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, do ſo far contradict Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his outſide profeſſion, as to make that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169758:33"/>for preſent viſibly unworthy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Taking it for granted, that the Word and Sacraments are notes of a true viſible Church, how doth it follow that ours are not true Churches, unleſs every particular member may partake of the Lords Supper? How many children and ſervants were in the daies of the Prelates kept from the Lords Supper, till they could give ſome tolerable account of their faith, and of the nature and uſe of the Sacrament; yet never was ſuch a mad inference as this drawn from it, that therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not a true viſible Church. And certainly, if the deniall of ſome Church priviledge (though unjuſtly) were enough to un-Church a people, I ſcarce know where there is any one true viſible Church in all the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore let all the world take notice of the too too groſs fallacy of this Argument, The Word and Sacraments are notes of a true viſible Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Without free admiſſion we have no true viſible Church. May not any ordinary capacity eaſily diſcern there are four tearms in this Syllogiſme.</p>
            <p>The Syllogiſme ſhould run thus: The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169758:33"/>Word and Sacraments are eſſentiall notes of a true viſible Church;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> without the Word and Sacraments there is no true viſible Church. But that Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> ſaw well enough would conclude nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, who (bleſſed be God) have both Word and Sacraments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſtead thereof (againſt the known rules of Logick) he ſhuffles in free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the concluſion, which was not at all in the premiſes. A clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he is more skill'd in Sophiſtry then in Logick, and can better deceive then convince.</p>
            <p>If on the other hand, he will make free admiſſion to the Lords Supper an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall mark of a true viſible Church; let him ſee how he is confuted by the practice of our Church under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, in which many were kept from the Lords Supper, that were neither chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, fools, nor excommunicated, and that without any prejudice to the eſſence of our Churches, as was before inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Yea, the very Rubrick before the Communion in the Book of Common-Prayer, ſhews the fondneſs of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; the Curate being there authorized to ſuſpend ſcandalous and malicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169758:34"/>without (I hope) any prejudice to the true being of our Churches. Yea, the very Exhortation in the Communion commands ſuch to bewail their ſins, and not to come, leſt after the taking of the Sacrament, the Devil entred into them as he did into <hi>Judas.</hi> Now were it a duty for all to come, then were it a ſin to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If yet he will object, This practice of ours, if it be not againſt the nature and eſſence, yet its againſt the wellbeing of a true viſible Church, when the members thereof, or any of them, are denied their juſt priviledges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. True, if the Lords Supper were a priviledge due to all Members; but this is the thing to be proved on Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his part; and in the proof whereof (though his great <hi>Diana</hi>) he falls ſo exceeding ſhort.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The well being of a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts much in its Government and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, (of which not one word from Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in his notes of a true viſible Church) Good Government lies in the Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call (not Arithmeticall) adminiſtration of priviledges and Cenſures: the loweſt of which laſt (Admonition) and higheſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169758:34"/>(Excommunication) we have clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Scripture: but becauſe Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion and the like, are not in tearms mentioned in Scripture, therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have it wholly expunged; as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man will not be gained by words, there were no other way but preſently to knock him on the head. Certainly, he that puts the extreames, cannot deny the middle from one extream to another. And as he who hath power of life and death, hath much more power to mulct, impriſon, &amp;c. ſo the Church who hath power to excommunicate, hath much more power to ſuſpend, as being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Cenſure, and but the way to that higheſt. Will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deny, that the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of a Church lies much in its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and this in the knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Members? and whether our way or his conduce more to this, let all the world judge. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tell me ingenuouſly, whether he would have all groſly ignorant perſons excommunicated? I hope he is more charitable, and thinks they rather need inſtruction. And is not this previous triall before the Elderſhip uſed of purpoſe, that ignorant perſons might be put upon enquiry after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169758:35"/>as ever they value the priviledge of Sacramentall communion. Nor is the proper end of it excluſion from, but preparation of all ſorts for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for which in few months (by Gods grace) we dare undertake to fit the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, if they will be ruled by us.
<hi>Contra,</hi> if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his free Admiſſion obtain uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally without check, ſee if in a few years a Chaos of darkneſs and ignorance do not overſpread the face of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church. But I ſee I muſt contract.</p>
            <p>For his confirmation of this argument from the parable of the field, &amp;c. which he ſtiles an <hi>invincible ſupport, pag.</hi> 17. Alas poor man, how feeble muſt he needs be, when his beſt ſtrength is but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? If the Tares and Wheat muſt be ſeparated till the day of judgement, then I pray what will become of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? Its apparent by the parable, 1. That the Tares were ſowen by the careleſneſs of the Servants, or other Church members,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.25. 2. That the prohibition to take them away, was not abſolute, but onely with a caution or <hi>proviſo, verſe</hi> 29. And in truth, ſo tender is the Lord of the Wheat, that he had rather many Tares ſhould ſtand, then
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169758:35"/>one ear of Corn ſhould be pluckt up. Where therefore there is danger of wronging the wheat, better let the tares ſtand; not ſo if we can ſeparate them without prejudice to, yea with advantage of the wheat: And therefore a bare ſuſpition is not enough to keep any from the Sacrament, but by groſs ignorance or ſcandall it muſt appear he is a tare, and not wheat, before he can be ſuſpended judicially. For as for negative ſuſpenſion before triall, that is not properly a Church Cenſure (no more then the non-admitting of Infants or diſtracted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) but onely a prudentiall forbearing to adminiſter the Lords Supper to a perſon, till he have been approved as viſibly worthy, which yet may iſſue out into a formall Suſpenſion, if any ſhall wilfully obtrude without triall, or upon triall ſhall be found viſibly unworthy, and yet will not be perſwaded to forbear till better prepared.</p>
            <p>For his inſtance of Chriſts converſe with Publicanes and ſinners; it makes much for us, and againſt himſelf. Such Publicanes and ſinners who are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med publickly to profeſs their repentance and high reſpects to Chriſt, ſhall be very
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169758:36"/>welcome to us as the worthieſt receivers; but the queſtion is, Whether blinde and ſcandalous Phariſees ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theſe Publicanes and ſinners?</p>
            <p>For his grand inſtance of <hi>Judas,</hi> it hath been already anſwered. Onely I cannot but ſtand amazed at his high flown confidence and cenſoriouſneſs, pag. 19. <hi>The evidence of which fact</hi> (he means of Chriſts admitting <hi>Judas</hi> to receive the Lords Supper)
<hi>has ever appeared ſo fully to the Church, that this alone has been ground ſufficient to deduce their right of free admiſſion; and what need more indeed be urged, but that men when they are willing not to ſee, will let their hand (put over their eyes) be enough to blinde them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Sundry famous Lights in the Church beleeved this long before Mr. <hi>H.</hi> either preached or wrote, and yet thought it not ground enough for free admiſſion. But haply Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as to judge not onely the reformed Churches, but alſo the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> (ever ſince the dawning of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation after the
<hi>Marian</hi> perſecution to this day) to have wilfully put their hands over their eyes, and knowingly to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169758:36"/>have ſinned againſt their conſciences. We may well bear this ſharp cenſure with the more comfort and patience, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſuffer with ſo good company.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See you not how the vizard of humility falls off, and both his breath and pen ſavour rankly of pride in this unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cenſure? Were we as bad as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would make us, we had undoubtedly made a great progreſs in the high way to the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our ſelves not onely to be ſuſpended, but alſo to be excommunicated. In the mean time I muſt be bold to tell Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that he who takes upon himſelf to be ſo free an admitter of others, deſerves, I fear, more then ſuſpenſion for this his ſcandalous and wicked cenſure of the generality of the moſt pious perſons of all the reformed Churches, and particularly his own Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His third reaſon he takes from the nature of Chriſtian communion and Church fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, which ought to be in charity, in humility, without judging, every one eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others better then themſelves, &amp;c. eſpecially in the Miniſter, who is to be gentle to all, ſuffering the evil (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to win them by this free way to repentance. And
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169758:37"/>how impoſsible is this, if we muſt go to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of mens worthineſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, preferring our ſelves; rejecting others; the ready way to nothing but heart burnings and diviſions, as we have too ſad experience already in moſt Congregations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When men are out of the right way once, whither will they not ramble? Raſh judgement and private judgement cannot ſtand with charity and humility (out of his own mouth I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the man, who may well be ſtiled Maſter of Arts at raſh and private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,)
<hi>ergo,</hi> true and publick judging cannot ſtand with charity and humility. Doth he not in this deal with the Church, as ſome Anabaptiſts deal with the State, take away the Sword of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſo make a fair bridge for univerſall Toleration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If there muſt be no judging in the Church, where then are Church Cenſures and Excommunication?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Epheſus</hi> is commended for trying and judging, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. and that ſhe could not bear thoſe that were evil, &amp;c. and not therefore charged by Chriſt as proud or uncharitable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12,13. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169758:37"/>them to judge Church Members, that is (in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Language) to be proud and uncharitable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Do we deſire anymore of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt then we ſubmit to our ſelves; yea, to a far ſtricter triall then they are like to undergo? how then do we lift up our ſelves above them, or eſteem our ſelves better then they?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Doth the gentleneſs required in a Miniſter, forbid him to try and inſtruct his people? I thought gentleneſs there required, had been rather a qualification then a prohibition of Miniſteriall triall.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there ſignifie a ſuffering the people in their ſins, that Miniſters ſhould be dumb dogs, and drowſie ſhepherds, ſuffering the ſheep to ramble as they pleaſe, and the ſwine to wallow as they pleaſe, &amp;c, and admit them to the ſame priviledges with the beſt? Such a Miniſter may well be counted a good fellow, but ſure Chriſt will never reckon him for a good and faithfull ſhepherd. Doth Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> think the way to bring to repentance, is to ſuffer them in their ſins? ot that there is no way to reduce them, but either admonition or excommunication? May
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169758:38"/>not perſons be won by deniall of ſome priviledges due to regular members, if they have not loſt ail ſpirituall inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity?</p>
            <p n="8">8. That hereby heart burnings and diviſions are occaſioned, blame not this excellent courſe, which of its own nature is a means of love and unity by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall communication of Paſtor and Flock, Elders and People, in gifts and graces: but the pride of moſt, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or prejudice of ſome well meaning people, who will not ſubmit to this eaſie yoke,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. nor do conſider, that the ruling Elders are either elected or eligible, 1. By them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. 2. Out of themſelves. 3. For their advantage, to allay the power of Miniſters, who if ſole Judges of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall worthineſs, might at leaſt be under a temptation to wrong weaker Chriſtians, and through paſſion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to keep them away, whom Chriſt would have to be admitted.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If by trying and judging others, we prefer our ſelves before others, then there muſt be no trying or judging of any in the Church; quite contrary to the Scripture, and the power of the Keyes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169758:38"/>given to Church-Officers. Beſides, let the Reader further take notice of the uncharitableneſs of this man. 1. In char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging us to prefer our ſelves before others. True indeed, what the Apoſtle ſaith of bleſſing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7. that may we of triall and judgement, The Trier and Judge is in that act above him that is tried and judged: but did we prefer our ſelves to this ſuperiority? or were we called to it both by Civill and Eccleſiaſticall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? Doth not Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> try and judge others in the exerciſe of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, doth he therefore prefer himſelf above his people? indeed if he ran be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſent, well may he bear that charge. But we challenge Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> and all the world, to name any among us who take upon them to try or judge others, before they were called to that Office. Let him take heed leſt in this raſh cenſure he be not like <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To load us the more, he brands us in the cloſe with the odious charge of
<hi>rejecting others,</hi> as if that were all the work of the Presbytery, to ſit and reject their brethren. He takes no notice how many are admitted, to the mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169758:39"/>and edification of themſelves and thoſe who are over them in the Lord, who bleſs God for the care our Builders take in purging and repairing Gods Houſe and the new
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> however oppoſed and diſcouraged by <hi>Sanballat, Tobiah,</hi> and other
<hi>Samaritans:</hi> and I wiſh too many (I hope reall <hi>Jews</hi>) did not too much correſpond with them, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. I am ſure Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> by this unhappy book of his, hath done <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> more ſervice then either
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> or <hi>Ezra,</hi> the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him.</p>
            <p>For amplification of his third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Page 20.</note> he preſents the example of the Phariſee and Publicane; and inſinuates that we at leaſt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> act the Phariſee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How doth it follow, that by triall of others we think better of our ſelves then of others, as the Phariſee did here? His judgement was purely private. 2. Without any triall: Ours is publick, upon juſt and indifferent triall, whereby often we are brought to think better of others, worſe of our ſelves, but never to think better of our ſelves then others, whom yet in ſome caſes we dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſince its poſſible one really worthy
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169758:39"/>may be ſuſpended, and another onely viſibly worthy may be admitted; ſince in this, as well as other trials, the Eider-ſhip muſt proceed only <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> and he who is worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, may be unworthy diſpoſitively. And here again he chargeth us with ſuperſtition and uncharitableneſs, becauſe we will not admit all freely; as if there were no Meane between profaneſs and ſuperſtition, between charity and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>His ſecond inſtance for amplification, is from <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.31, 32. (the quotation is miſtaken by his Printer, and the ſenſe by himſelf) wherein Chriſt is repreſented as a Phyſician onely of the ſick, and came to call, not the righteous, but ſinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What is this againſt us who make it our deſign to admit none but ſuch ſick ones and ſinners as Chriſt did?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It makes much againſt himſelf, if he will urge it in order to the Sacrament, ſince its evident Chriſt here makes a diſtinction and ſeparation; and 1. Would not have all admitted; and 2. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular he rejects ſound and righteous ones, namely that were ſo in their own conceit, and ſuch were moſt of the Phariſees:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169758:40"/>and do we ſuſpend any others then thoſe who ate wiſer in their own eyes then ſeven men that can render a reaſon, and fitter for the Lords Supper (if themſelves may be judges) then the beſt of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or approvers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. His third inſtance is <hi>John</hi> 8. from the woman taken in adultery, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the Phariſees, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by our Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Doth this man take the Scripture for a noſe of wax, that he perverts it ſo groſly, cither through ignorance, inſtability, or prejudice? (to ſay no worſe) what is this to our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall triall? The Phariſees came to trap Chriſt with a practicall caſe and a civill caſe, <hi>John</hi> 8.5, 6. Had Chriſt bid them ſtone her, he had been accuſed to the Romans as ſtirring the Jews up to act the ſupreme power which was taken from them by the Romans; ſee <hi>John</hi> 18.31. Had he forbid them to ſtone her, he had been ſlandered to the Jews, as an enemy to, and contradictor of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Our Saviour at firſt waves an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to ſo captious a queſtion, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. But when that would not ſatisfie their malicious importunity, he gives them ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169758:40"/>wiſe an anſwer, as 1. He avoyded both extreams; and 2. He caught them who came to catch him; And for the woman, though he condemn not her perſon either to civill death, as being no civill Judge, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.14. nor eternally, as not coming (in the ſtate of humiliation) to deſtroy, but to ſave, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.56. <hi>John</hi> 12.47. yet he condemns her ſin, and gives her good counſel, <hi>John</hi> 8.11. What is this to our keeping perſons viſibly unworthy from the Sacrament, and that by juſt authority in a publick and judiciall way? I wonder this man doth not now condemn the civill Magiſtrate for executing adulterers, inceſtuous perſons, Sodomites, &amp;c. which Chriſt and his Apoſtles would not, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 6, 9, 11. onely they judged them ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, ſhewed them the danger of thoſe ſins, and Gods mercy in pardoning and purging them. Are not many juſtly cut off both by the Civill and Eccleſiaſticall Sword, whom yet Chriſt, as abſolute Lord of life and death, may pardon? Shall not man do juſtice, becauſe Chriſt ſhews mercy? Had this woman been ſtoned to death, had that been any barre to Chriſts Pardon? The moſt righteous Judge in the world is conſcious of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169758:41"/>ſeeds of inceſt, murder, &amp;c. in himſelf, ſhall he not therefore condemn ſuch perſons legally convicted before him? The moſt pious Miniſter or Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer is conſcious of the like, ſhall he not therefore either ſuſpend or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſuch perſons, when legally converged and convicted upon juſt triall? <hi>David</hi> himſelf was actually guilty both of murder and adultery, was it ever after unlawfull for him as a King and Judge, to condemn ſuch perſons? Indeed the conſciouſneſs of our own weakneſs and guilt, ſhould make us put forth ſuch acts with abundance of ſelf-reflection and pity to ſuch offenders, but hath not the leaft ſhew of warrant to root up or make void the power of triall and judgement, either in Church or State. Fooliſh pitty mars a City in this caſe, ſhall the woolf be ſpared to worry the ſheep? If ſuch pity be not the greateſt cruelty both to ſoul and body, I know not what is.</p>
            <p>Pag. 22. <hi>His fourth reaſon ariſes from the vanity, formality, and impoſſibility of ſelecting people to this Ordinance. For put the caſe you will have a gathered company, I pray whom do you account to be fit and worthy receivers? if not all that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169758:41"/>as we do mixtly, then thoſe only that have an intereſt in Chriſt, and are true Believers. Well, but how will you be able to know them? The heart of man is deceitfull above all things, who can know it? And if we can hardly diſcover our own hearts, how ſhall we ever diſcern others? So that all will come but to thoſe that have the faireſt ſhew, thoſe that ſeem ſuch; and you cannot be ſecured but there may be and will be ſome hypocrites; and ſo this true partaking, as all one body and one blood, in ſuch a mixt communion as you pretend, vaniſhes, and there can be no ſuch matter. But now if men here ſtand upon a formall purity, and will have the outward pureſt Church they can, they go to ſeparating again (as we have daily teſtimony) till they are quite ſeparated one from another; even as in the peeling of an onyon, where you may peel and peel till you have brought all to nothing, unleſs to a few teares perchance, with which the eyes of good men muſt needs run over in the doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> thinks he hath us faſt: But let me intreat him not to boaſt before he put off his harneſs. And that both himſelf and others may ſee how wide he roves from the mark,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169758:42"/>we ſhall deny both his Extreams, and tell him that neither bate profeſſion on the one hand, nor troth of grace on the other hand, is the rule we walk by in admitting perſons to the Sacrament, if conſidered <hi>quatenus.</hi> Could not all the art Mr.
<hi>Humphrey</hi> hath, think of <hi>medium participationis,</hi> between theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, which will do very good ſervice for his conviction and our juſtification?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore let him know, that we look at his rule of bare profeſſion, as a very looſe principle, which will open a door not onely for the wickedeſt var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, as murderers, &amp;c. but alſo for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and fools, contrary to his own principles, now in print. And indeed, if bare proſeſſion were enough to warrant admiſſion to the Sacrament, how dares Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> excommunicate any bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſon, though he be the wickedeſt villain that ever <hi>Tyburn</hi> groaned for, ſince even the worſt of them are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as well as the trueſt <hi>Nathanael?</hi> Therefore ſay we, Profeſſion, if joyned with ſufficiency of knowledge in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, and ſutable practice in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, at leaſt negatively, that there be no evidence againſt a perſon, as living
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169758:42"/>after conviction in a known ſin; this is the rule we walk by in admiſſion to the Sacraments; though withall, we do not neglect inquiry after truth of grace, ſo far as may ſtand with charity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let him and the world know, that truth of grace in the heart on the other hand is not our rule of admitting to the Lords Supper. The reaſon is, becauſe we cannot admit divers perſons, though we ſhould infallibly know they had truth of grace; as 1. Children and fools, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of whom undoubtedly have truth of grace in their hearts; and that becauſe they cannot examine themſelves, nor diſcern the Lords body according to the rule of the Apoſtle, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28, 29. Nor 2. Such, who though they have truth of grace, yet fall into ſome foul and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſin, for which they deſerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication it ſelf, and much more ſuſpenſion, which is but an inferiour degree of excommunication. As truth of grace cannot excuſe a man from death, if he be a murderer, &amp;c. ſo neither can it excuſe him from Church Cenſures, if he be foully ſcandalous, eſpecially if wilfull; which yet for a time may ſtand with truth of grace, witneſs <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:169758:43"/>16.10, 12. Doth not Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> know that a perſon habitually worthy may be actually unworthy? or that a perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly unworthy may be viſibly worthy; and <hi>contra?</hi> Did he never hear of the worthineſs of perſon and the worthineſs of preparation, viſible worthineſs and reall worthineſs? Reall and compleat worthineſs (I mean as to its parts, when a perſon hath grace, and in ſome meaſure of truth labours to fit himſelf) is onely known to God: outward or viſible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness may be known to man by due ſearch and triall, accompanied with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and prudence, in which better to fail on the right hand then on the left; and where we ſee competent knowledge and have nothing to object againſt a mans converſation, the perſon profeſſing his univerſall ſubjection to Chriſt, and deſire to receive for his further edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Elderſhip ought to give ſuch a one the right hand of fellowship. And ſhould he afterwards be uncaſed, the ſame power of the Keyes which admitted him, can either ſuſpend or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, according to the demerit of his carriage.</p>
            <p>And whereas he objects, That do what
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169758:43"/>we can, hypocrites will creep in: That we eaſily grant, but its nothing to his purpoſe, ſince not hypocrites ſimply, but hypocrites as uncaſed, or godly men as groſly extravagant, are the object of Church Cenſures. The beſt uſe therefore can be made of his peel'd onyon, is to draw tears from his own and others eyes for theſe extravagant diſcourſes of his, whereby he hath (as much as in him lies) troubled the Church, hindred Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtrengthened the hands of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſadned the hearts of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whom God hath not made ſad, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22. Had we the peeling of his onyon, we would take off onely the skin, and make good uſe of the pulp, either for food, ſauce, or medicine. And ſo much good do him with his Onyon, whether he feed upon it, or weep over it.</p>
            <p>Pag. 23. <hi>His fifth reaſon he gathers from the uniformity of the ſervice of God. If all other Worſhip lies in common, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment upon the common liberty, to put an encloſure upon the Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let him anſwer himſelf; if all other worſhip lie in common (for this I ſuppoſe he means by uniformity) for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and diſtracted perſons (unleſs they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169758:44"/>trouble the Congregation) why doth Mr. <hi>H.</hi> encloſe the Lords Supper from them? Let him extricate himſelf, and then ſee if we come not out at the ſame gap. Where hath Chriſt <hi>in terminis</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid children and diſtracted perſons to receive? If Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> can exclude them by conſequence, the ſame or like conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will ſerve us to exclude divers far more unfit to receive then either of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Muſt all Divine Service be laid in common, becauſe moſt parts of it are? Why then not all time, becauſe ſix parts of time are ſo? why not all places and perſons, becauſe many are? Let us bleſs God ſo much of his Service lies in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and not quarrell that all lies not in common, ſince the beſt are unworthy that any part of Gods Worſhip ſhould lie in common.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no part of Gods Worſhip ſo encloſed, but all perſons of age and diſcretion may injoy it, if the fault be not their own, and that upon very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and equall, yea eaſie conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As in every Ordinance ſome part is in common, ſome part incloſed, ſo is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169758:44"/>it in the Sacrament. In every Ordinance a great part of the Letter is common to all, the ſpirit of it is incloſed. In prayer I can bleſs God for truth of grace wrought in ſome, but can I without ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſe him for true grace wrought in all? In preaching the Miniſter ought to apply ſome commands univerſally, others to ſuch and ſuch ſtates, conditions, and ſexes; threatnings to obſtinate ſinners, promiſes to the penitent, &amp;c. Is not here a plain incloſure? If all parts of prayer or preaching be not applicable to all, ſhall all parts of the Sacrament be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all? We deny not but all may be preſent at the exhortation, conſecration, adminiſtration; but the queſtion is, Whether all may actually receive, and whether the ſeal may be applied to them whom the Covenant of grace <hi>in ſtatu quo</hi> is viſibly inapplicable.</p>
            <p>Hereby alſo will appear the weakneſs of what he adds by way of amplification, <hi>Are all the commands of God univerſall? why not (Do this) alſo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Many commands of God are not univerſall, as was ſhewed before; and why then may not this be of that number?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:169758:45"/>2. If this command of actuall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be univerſall, why doth himſelf li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it by excluding ſome perſons?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then it were a ſin for the Miniſter or any other to perſwade any to forbear the Sacrament, though he came with his hands imbrewed in blood, or actually drunk, or played the part of <hi>Zimri</hi> or <hi>Cosby</hi> in the face of the Congregation immediately before the Sacrament: For neither can my wickedneſs, nor the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of any creature, looſe the bands of an univerſall command. Were I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this were Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement, as I have ground to ſuſpect from what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers <hi>pag.</hi> 7. haply I might ſay more to him, but till then ſhall forbear.</p>
            <p>What further he objects is truth, <hi>That an unregenerate man ſins in every ſervice and duty, yet muſt not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereupon plead a</hi> quietus eſt <hi>from ſervice:</hi> but there is not <hi>par ratio</hi> in order to receiving. 1. Becauſe its not every mans duty to receive.
2, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other duties, though ſinfully by him performed (inſtance particularly in hearing the Word preached) may be means of his converſion, not ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament unworthily received; of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:169758:45"/>In the ſame Page he throws his glove, firſt to the Independents, then to the Presbyterians. To the former in theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let our Independents anſwer, Why do you allow a</hi> Syntax <hi>in the whole Service of God beſides, and bring in a</hi> Quae genus <hi>of Anomalás and Heteroclites onely at this Ordinance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Independents are much beholding to him for his favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, as good Proficients in Chriſts School. They are good Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians indeed, if they have perfected the Chriſtian Grammar ſo, as to leave in it but one <hi>Anomalum</hi> or
<hi>Heteroclite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I think its rather <hi>optandum</hi> then <hi>credendum,</hi> that they allow a
<hi>Syntaxis</hi> in the whole Service of God beſides.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet as to free admiſſion in order unto preſence at all Ordinances, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they (as well as we) allow a <hi>ſyntax</hi> in the whole worſhip of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Heteroclites and Anomala's are no more abſurd in Worſhip, then they are in Grammar. As no rule in Grammar but bath its exception, ſo no part of Worſhip but hath its incloſure. Of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:169758:46"/>And therefore though I cannot juſtifie any of the Independents in ſeparating from our Congregations, yet if in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Lords Supper perſons viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unworthy, they act upon the ſame principles with us; in ſo doing, though <hi>they bring in a</hi> Quae genus <hi>of Anomalacs and Heteroclites at the Lords Supper,</hi> yet they violate not the <hi>Syntax</hi> of Divine Worſhip. If they walk by other rules or principles not warranted, let them plead for themſelves, I am not of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</p>
            <p>But for his challenge to the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (or at leaſt ſome of them) <hi>How we can admit of children as Members of the viſible Church (being born of Chriſtian Parents) unto Baptiſme, and yet turn away the Parents of thoſe children from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? Thoſe that have gone about to anſwer this, had better haply have ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for our free courſe of Baptiſme and a deniall of this, is ſuch a ſeam-rent as will never be handſomely drawn up, though ſtitcht together. Nevertheleſs in yeelding the one, they have granted the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How can Mr. <hi>H.</hi> admit the children themſelves to Baptiſme, and yet deny them the Lords Supper? If herein
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169758:46"/>he act by faith, let him ſhew a Divine Precept by which he excludes them. If he bring a proof by conſequence, let him conſider if that or a like conſequence will not exclude others (as well as children) for whom he keeps the door open.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How can himſelf admit children to Baptiſme, and yet excludes their parents from the Lords Supper? If the parents of a child baptized be either diſtracted or excommunicated, Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> being Judge, they ought not to be admitted to the Lords Supper; whereby its apparent, that even in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement, the childes baptiſme is no neceſſary medium to prove the Parents muſt be admitted to the Lords Supper; which yet he urgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, but forgets how he wounds himſelf with the ſame weapon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To come cloſer to the Objection; two things by way of anſwer are very conſiderable, 1. That we clear and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the promiſcuous baptizing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtian Parents, be the Parents themſelves never ſo unworthy. 2. That the promiſcuous admiſſion of children to Baptiſme, is no ground for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous admiſſion of their parents to the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:169758:47"/>For the firſt of theſe: We admit chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Baptiſme, 1. By vertue of their remote parents, who may be good though their immediate parents be bad, Acts 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is made to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off,</hi> &amp;c. To your children indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, not to your next children onely. Which is yet more evident by comparing
<hi>Levit.</hi> 26.45. &amp; <hi>Micah</hi> 7.20. where the Covenant of Anceſtors and Parents ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the children for many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till the children themſelves in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon renounce the Covenant. This alſo is hinted in the Text under the notion <hi>of them that are afar off,</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendable not only to remoteneſs of place or of ſtate, but alſo to remoteneſs of time; that is, as <hi>Beza</hi> notes, to your children in remote ages to come,
<hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus longè poſt futuris.</hi> Nor is it in the Originall <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Gentiles were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. and ſo oppoſed to <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. In this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, mercy triumphs over juſtice, in that God who puniſhes the parents ſin to the fourth generation, extends Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-mercy to a thouſand generations,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169758:47"/>
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. Nor was <hi>Peters</hi> deſign here to foretell the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, but to incourage his Auditors to faith and repentance; ſince (as <hi>Beza</hi> well notes upon the place) the myſtery of the Gentiles votation was not yet known to <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, nor was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to be revealed to theſe new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, had he known it never ſo well. As the Covenant of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of
<hi>Abraham;</hi> as the Covenant of Works, ſo the Covenant of Grace is extendible to many generations: and where the root is holy, there not only the immediate, but alſo the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote branches are federally holy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. and that whether the branches be naturall or ingrafted, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Children may be admitted by ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of others to ſee them educated in the faith into which they are baptized, be the parents themſelves never ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yea excommunicated, yea Papiſts, and thus baſtards and foundlings may be baptized. See
<hi>Ameſius</hi> his Caſes, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. Nay upon this account divers learned men very probably conceive, that even Heathen children may be baptized, if once taken into a Chriſtian
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169758:48"/>Family, where the Governour or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours undertake for their Chriſtian education, and they are out of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of their Heathen parents; for by being members of a Chriſtian Family, they are made members of the viſible Church, as civill, though not naturall children of Chriſtians. I am ſure this Doctrine is conſonant to the Analogy of Circumciſion, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17.12. where not onely the childe born in the houſe, but alſo bought with money, was to be circumciſed, yea bought of ſtrangers, and not of the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> as is expreſs and evident in the Text. Thus an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then born in the houſe, or bought with money might eat of the holy things, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe is ſomething conſiderable in the immediate parents, which makes their children capable of Baptiſme; and 1. Though they tranſgreſs, yet they do not renounce the Covenant (as Turks do.) 2. They are Members of the viſible Church till excommunicated, and why may not the children be admitted to the ſame priviledge the parents yet injoy? provided their tender age be capable of that priviledge; and children are as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169758:48"/>of Baptiſme as they were of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, both being paſſive Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be cleared is, That the promiſcuous admiſſion of children to Baptiſme, is no ground for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous admiſſion of their parents to the Lords Supper. This is evident, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more is required to make a perſon capable of the Lords Supper, then an Infant capable of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Perſonall unworthineſs may eaſily appear in the parent, which cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Infant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is not ſimple memberſhip gives an immediate right to the Lords Supper: and therefore though the parents mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip do regularly make the childe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Church memberſhip (and ſo give it a right to Baptiſme) yet neither his own nor his childes Church memberſhip can make the parent capable of the Lords Supper, a priviledge not for every Church member, but for a viſibly worthy Church member. Suppoſe the ſame perſon (<hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> for inſtance) baptized regularly in his riper years, yea and admitted to the Lords Supper alſo, as viſibly worthy: afterwards he walks ſcandalouſly; he is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169758:49"/>1. Admoniſhed. 2. Suſpended. 3. If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting obſtinate, diſmembred. I beſeech you what irregular proceeding is here?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore if the promiſcuous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of children to Baptiſme is no ground for their own promiſcuous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Lords Supper, much leſſ is the promiſcuous dimiſſion of children to Baptiſme, any ground of their parents promiſcuous dimiſſion to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The parent gives to his child what himſelf hath, namely Church member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but cannot thence claim what is the priviledge of a worthy Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, namely Sacramentall Communion. The ſon of a Jew or Proſelyte (being clean) might eat of the Paſſeover, when at the ſame time the father (in whoſe right the childe was circumciſed) being unclean, might not partake of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A Prieſts ſon or daughter might in their fathers right (being clean) eat of the holy things: when at the ſame time the father himſelf (being unclean) was forbid to eat of them. Compare <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.11. &amp; <hi>Levit.</hi>
22.4, 6. There is <hi>par ratio</hi> of morall pollutions. A wicked parent who deſerves the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of excommunication, yet being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169758:49"/>a Church member, his childe ſhall be baptized in his right, and by Baptiſme be ſolemnly admitted into the priviledge of Church memberſhip, which yet the father injoyes; when at the ſame time the father ſhall be debarred the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a worthy Church member; namely, Sacramentall communion at the Lords Table. The parents foederall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſhall benefit his childe at the very ſame time when his antifoederall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall prejudice himſelf.</p>
            <p>There is then no ſeam rent in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices or principles, unleſs it be in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his brain, which if we can neither draw nor ſtitch, well may it be our ſorrow, but we truſt it ſhall never be our ſin.</p>
            <p>In his third Edition, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. he makes an addition to fortifie his fifth reaſon, by impeaching us, <hi>That by urging our form as neceſſary, we violate a branch of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, equalizing Ordinances of men,</hi> Col. 2.18, 20. <hi>with Divine Ordinances; which humane Ordinances, though we might ſubmit to as prudentiall onely, yet he dares not ſuffer them to creep into the ſeat of God, namely conſcience. Its ill putting Gods Worſhip upon ſtilts, leſt by ſeeking to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it higher, we give it a fall into
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169758:50"/>dangerous ſcruples and diviſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let the Reader take notice that (in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement) the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a barre to free admiſſion is an humane, not a Divine Ordinance. Could we be of his faith, we would be more againſt this barre then himſelf is. We bleſs God that an humane Ordinance doth civilly or eccleſiaſtically back a Divine Ordinance, but like not the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of humane inventions upon conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, eſpecially in Divine Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ask him, whether his excluding of Infants and diſtracted perſons, be a Divine Ordinance? If ſo, let us ſee his patent out of Scripture either in tearms or by conſequence; and if the very ſame or a like Divine Patent do not exclude all perſons viſibly unworthy, we ſhall be of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Religion, to admit all pell mell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſing the barre to free admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had been only a prudentiall humane Ordinance, I ſay Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> had done God and the Church more ſervice in ſubmitting to it, then in diſputing againſt it; ſince 1. As a prudentiall it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rule of Scripture. 2. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might by conſequence be deduced
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169758:50"/>from Scripture, as a thing 1. Lawfull. 2, Expedient. 3. Commanded by lawfull authority, Civill and Eccleſiaſticall, yea in the very times of the Prelates. And if the lawfull commands of Superiours <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> be not obligatory to conſcience, let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> raſe out the fifth Commandment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We put Gods Worſhip no more upon ſtilts then himſelf doth, excluding onely perſons that are viſibly uncapable of the Lords Supper; and if diſtracted perſons are uncapable in his judgement, ſcandalous perſons are more uncapable in our judgement. Therefore in his Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der der let him either juſtifie us, or condemn himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His ſixth and laſt Argument is drawn from his innocency in free admiſſion,</hi> and that upon a ſixfold account: 1. <hi>Becauſe therein he doth but his duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is but <hi>petitio principii,</hi> the main thing to be proved, eſpecially if he lay it down as a generall rule for all Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe he hath no power to turn away any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I take this for one of the trueſt paſſages in all his book, upon ſuppoſition
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169758:51"/>that he hath no Presbytery ſettled in his Congregation. But little doth Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> conſider how this conceſſion makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, and ſubverts a main argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, drawn from the example of <hi>Judas:</hi> For ſuppoſing him to have been viſibly unworthy, yet ſay we, Chriſt as a Miniſter had no juridicall power to turn him or any other away, ſince he could not legally be both Judge and Witneſs; and there being then no Presbytery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to try unworthy Receivers by. Which alſo at this day is the caſe of moſt Pariſhes in <hi>England.</hi> And for my own part, I much doubt whether a Miniſter by his own power can exclude any Church member from the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>he hopes the beſt of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. So did the Angel of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who yet tried and uncaſed the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 4. 2. So did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who yet commanded Chriſtians to mark and avoid unworthy Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5.11. &amp; 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14, 15. 3. So muſt Magiſtrates, yet I hope they may and do condemn Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. 4. If this be a good argument, may not Mr. <hi>H.</hi> as well conclude, I hope the beſt of all, therefore I will excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169758:51"/>none. Though charity hope the beſt, yet it is not ſtark blinde; and I think its no mean point of charity to prevent the ruine of many poor ſoules, who ruſh on headlong to contract the guilt of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe <hi>he knows God can turn even the worſt at this Ordinance if he pleaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Suppoſe a ſcandalous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor actually converted by the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding exerciſes at the Sacrament, this is not ground enough for the Church to permit him at that time to receive, ſince the rule they walk by is viſible worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 2. The queſtion is not what abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely God can do, but what God doth or hath undertaken to do. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhew one promiſe or preſident for ſo much as one perſon coming to the Lords Supper in the ſtate of nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by it or at it. 3. Whatever any may be by the exhortation, &amp;c. at the Sacrament, yet the main queſtion is, Whether any be converted by actuall receiving the outward Elements, who immediately before receiving was uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. A promiſe or preſident in this kinde will be much to the purpoſe; but till then, we muſt crave pardon if we hold
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169758:52"/>not free admiſſion in order to participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though we ſhall not deny free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in order to univerfall preſence at the whole Service. Prove actuall recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a converting Ordinance, and we ſhall be as zealous for free admiſſion as Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> can be.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Becauſe he endeavours his utmoſt</hi> de jure <hi>that all come prepared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. So high a commendation were fitter to come out of any mans mouth then Mr.
<hi>H. Prov.</hi> 22.7. 2. Its a commendation too high for any mortall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall be bold to tell him, that in this ſelf <hi>Encomium</hi> he ſpeaks falſly. Did ever any meer man ſince the fall indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his utmoſt <hi>de jure</hi> that all his Flock might be worthy receivers (ſuch are all that come prepared.) Doth he not know that one worthy in Chriſts account, muſt 1. Be converted. 2. Unblameable, yea exemplary in his converſation. 3. Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prepared, by exciting and acting the Sacramentall graces? And hath Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> indeavoured his utmoſt <hi>de jure</hi> that all his people ſhould be ſuch? nay, hath he indeavoured his utmoſt <hi>de jure</hi> that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may be ſuch? Did he never ſince he was a Miniſter fail (through careleſneſs,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169758:52"/>yea wilfulneſs ſometimes) in praying for his people, in preaching, in example, in private reproof, admonition, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, triall? &amp;c. Is he without ſins of weakneſs, careleſneſs, yea ſometimes wilfulneſs as a Miniſter? and dares he cry at Chriſts Barre (as he boaſts in his Book) <hi>That he hath endeavoured his utmoſt</hi> de jure
<hi>that all come prepared?</hi> If this ſmell not ſtrong of ſublime Phariſaiſme,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11,12. I beſeech you what doth? You ſaw his pride formerly in cenſuring others, and very many far his betters, mark now how the bladder ſwells with ſelf conceit and applauſe. The Lord help him to ſee the beam in his own eye, who is ſo quickſighted to eſpy a moat in his Brothers eye.</p>
            <p>Its well therefore that in his laſt and third Edition he begins in part to cry <hi>peccavi, pag.</hi> 26. in theſe words: <hi>This I ſuppoſe, but wo is me if I juſtifie my ſelf, who am a man of unclean lips, and dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent onely in our failings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It ſeems then this proud and confident aſſertion proves at laſt (by his own grant) but a ſuppoſition. 2. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, though falſe, may be grounds of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169758:53"/>truth, but falſe ſuppoſitions aſſerted (as here) are many times dangerous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious untruths. 3. For any to aſſert he hath endeavoured his utmoſt
<hi>de jure</hi> in a courſe or ſeries of actions, is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous falſhood both for the Aſſertor and the receivers. 4. That his own conſcience checkt him for this proud and falſe aſſertion, is apparent by thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>But wo is me if I juſtifie my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Yet what higher ſelf juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can there be, then to ſtand upon tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes with God, and ſay, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured my utmoſt <hi>de jure?</hi> A godly man may in humility and ſincerity uſe the words of the Phariſee, <hi>I thank thee, O God, I am not like other men.</hi> But what godly man dares ſay to God, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured my utmoſt <hi>de jure?</hi> The Lord give him grace fully and publickly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and not to minſe or excuſe his pride in this particular, leſt God one day ſhew him to his coſt the vanity of his former aſſertion and latter ſuppoſition, and he be found in the number of thoſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones, who need no repentance of pardon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.7.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>He humbly confeſſeth all their and his own ſins</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Hezekiah)
<hi>deſiring true
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169758:53"/>repentance, and a pardon for all his and their omiſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If here he ſpeak really, and confeſs and beg pardon for his Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as well as perſonall omiſſions, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but approve it as an act of humility after his former vaunting. But then note how he contradicts his former proud aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion (I wiſh his book and heart too were fuller of ſuch contradictions, both for his own and his peoples ſake.) If he have done his utmoſt <hi>de jure,</hi> what need he deſire pardon for his omiſſions? If he be guilty of too many omiſſions, how hath he endeavoured his utmoſt <hi>de jure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Will confeſſion of our own and others ſins ſerve the turn, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable indeavour to reform our ſelves and others in our places? What is this but to lye in the ditch and cry God help us? And if the unworthieſt may enjoy the priviledges of the moſt penitent and humble Chriſtians, is this like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or to harden them, as if they were as good as the beſt? Should a Phyſician thus venture the iſſue upon God, and give phyſick that might kill as well as cure, I think no wiſe man would judge it an act of faith, but of high preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169758:54"/>on Should any onely give warning of danger, and not labour actually what he could to prevent it, all his warning will not quit him of murder before God. Is crying after a wandring ſheep enough to ſave it out of the pit? the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſure was of another minde, <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>pulling them out of the fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. What doth he in his confeſſion and prayer for pardon, more then we do, be Communicants either really or viſibly never ſo worthy in an Evangelicall ſenſe? onely here we go beyond him in our actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care and indeavour to fit all ſorts for the Sacrament by perſonall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examination, counſell and prayer, which he doth not: yet he thinks he hath indeavoured his utmoſt <hi>de jure;</hi> we, though we do far more then Mr. <hi>H.</hi> are aſſured we fall very ſhort of doing or indeavouring out utmoſt <hi>de jure,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the beſt Miniſter under heaven never yet indeavoured his utmoſt <hi>de jure</hi> to fit his people for the Lords Supper. Upon all which accounts well weighed, I believe Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath little cauſe to boaſt of his innocency, or bring that for an argument to juſtifie his free admiſſion, as he doth <hi>pag.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:169758:54"/>Two other conſiderations he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to adde <hi>ex abundanti:</hi> the firſt drawn <hi>from the command and good of coming, p.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>For the Command, I ask, Where doth Chriſt command all to receive? If it be urged, He bid all the Apoſtles to receive,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Were there no other Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers but the Apoſtles? what thinks he of <hi>Mark, Luke, Nathanael,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſciples that received not?</p>
            <p>I, but he bid all preſent to receive, yea <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Suppoſing <hi>Judas</hi> were preſent, he as well as the reſt being an eminent profeſſor. 2. A very knowing perſon. 3. Not legally convinced of ſcandall, I ſee not how he could have been denied the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>I, but the Apoſtle bids all members of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> come and receive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Let him ſhew that alſo if he can from the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. I am ſure he convinces and threatens all that come unworthily, but I ſee not where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all to receive abſolutely. 3. Why ſhould Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or any put thoſe aſunder which God hath joyned together; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, examination and receiving. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. ſaies, <hi>Let a man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169758:55"/>himſelf and ſo let him eat;</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaies, Let a man eat though he do not examine himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Upon this account a naturall man alſo ſhould not attend the Word preached, ſince he cannot hear it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily before converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo, the Word is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of converſion, ſo not the Sacrament, therefore naturall men as well as others muſt hear that, but may not receive this. And this leads me to anſwer the other branch of his firſt Argument drawn from <hi>the good of coming, becauſe its a means by which they who want grace may receive it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. An Ordinance may be a means of grace in order either to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or edification. In order to converſion we deny that actuall receiving is a means of grace: In order to edification, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be a ſingular means of grace to the worthy receiver; but what is this to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his purpoſe?</p>
            <p>If he ſay, The Word and Prayer in order to conſecration may convert.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That we deny not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here permit a freer dimiſſion then M.<hi>H.</hi> namely, both for children, diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169758:55"/>and excommunicated perſons to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Sacrament; but not actually to receive till they be actually capable as perſons viſibly worthy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Want of grace is either graduall and ſenſible, or totall and inſenſible. The Sacrament (as before) is an eſpeciall means of grace for the former, but not for the latter. But this will come hereafter to be diſputed in its proper place, which makes me here to paſs it over only with a touch. By the way let the Reader obſerve theſe words of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pag.
26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though we may ſcruple how an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man can receive it as a pledge, yet as it is a means whereby grace is conveyed, there is no difficulty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth not the former branch juſtifie what hath formerly been proved, that the Lords Supper being a ſpeciall pledge of grace, may not be applied to one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly unworthy? and where is Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> then (himſelf being judge) if we prove its no means of grace in order to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? But that work I ſhall ſuſpend till I come to clear the grand objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the converting power of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>His laſt ſupernumerary Argument is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169758:56"/>drawn from <hi>the evil of omiſſion, ibid.</hi> This he confirms from the parallel neglect of Circumciſion and the Paſſeover, of which whoſoever were guilty <hi>were in danger to be cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> There's a wide difference between not receiving and neglecting of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; the latter is a great ſin, ſo not the former. Nor doth that man, who being convinced of his preſent unfitneſs, forbeares receiving, ſin as a neglector, but rather ſhews his high reſpect of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>For his inſtance from <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. it hath been anſwered already. Only where now he adds, <hi>That thoſe which came not to the Feaſt were deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In that he goes beyond the Text, which ſaies indeed, that they who murthered his ſervants were deſtroyed; not ſo of the reſt, but onely that they were excluded the Supper. And though it be a truth by conſequence they were deſtroyed, as being judicially deprived of Chriſt and of his grace, yet that makes not for, but againſt Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and ſhews clearly that by that Marriage Feaſt is not meant the lords Supper, there being many ſaved who never taſte
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169758:56"/>of the Lords Supper, but none can be ſaved who taſte not of the Marriage Feaſt.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore he adds in the ſame Paragraph, <hi>They are moſt unworthy of all who come not in to the Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It will not hold water on either hand, ſince 1. Thoſe who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Servants that invited them were more unworthy. 2. If we may judge by the penalty, he that came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Wedding Garment was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, the neglecters being for preſent onely deprived of the Supper, but he bound hand and foot and caſt into utter darkneſs, <hi>Matthew</hi> 22.13.
2. Dare Maſter <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſay they are unworn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy who come not alwaies to the Lords Supper? May not ſome ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yea ſometimes worldly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, juſtly excuſe a perſon for not coming? But I am ſure he that comes not to the Marriage Feaſt is alwaies unworn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; another clear evidence that by the Marriage Feaſt is not meant the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>To draw then to a cloſe of our anſwer to his firſt part, In oppoſition to Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> his aſſertion, <hi>pag.</hi> 26, Its neither a certain
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169758:57"/>duty on the Miniſters part to admit all, nor on the peoples part for all to receive, unleſs you underſtand it <hi>mediately,</hi> as the getting of aſſurance is a duty lies upon all, yet not immediately, but firſt they muſt get true grace, the ground of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. So all muſt come to the Sacrament; true, but firſt they muſt be prepared. All muſt be admitted to receive; true, but firſt they muſt be viſibly worthy. We keep not any away <hi>for fear of accident all ſcandall, or of committing an uncertain ſin, in the doing,</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would make the world believe <hi>pag.</hi> 26. (I ſpeak as to the rule we walk by, for what particular men upon occaſion may do through weakneſs or otherwiſe, I am no Patron of that) but to prevent certain ſcandall by the admiſſion of perſons viſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, as alſo the ſin and ruine of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receivers, who being admitted, would murder Chriſt, and eat and drink judgement to themſelves; as alſo our own partaking with other mens ſins, and bring acceſſary to the ruine of their poor ſouls: from all which guilt I beſeech the Lord to free Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and others of his minde and practice, who by this looſe principle of free admiſſion, &amp;c. have
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169758:57"/>laid the axe to the root of reformation. And whereas he is pleaſed to charge us in a rhetoricall way, <hi>as doing evil</hi> (by ſuſpending from the Sacrament) <hi>that good may come of it, and that therefore our dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is juſt,</hi> We ſhall make no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn but this, to beſeech God to forgive him, as we heartily do, this bitter ſpirit of cenſoriouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Whatever therefore he may think of the childe of his own begetting, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by that expreſſion in the foot of the ſame Page, <hi>I will not give you my reaſons by the heap, but by the weight,</hi> I leave it to the indifferent Readers judgement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>H.</hi> be not better at number then at weight. For my own part, I conceive that one good argument (which makes no number) would have weighed far more in the balance of the Sanctuary, and of ſolid reaſon, then all his eight arguments heaped up together.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>1</label> This Objection I conceive Mr. <hi>H.</hi> might have ſpared, there being no great ſtrength in it againſt free admiſſion, in his ſenſe, which admits not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated perſons.</p>
               <p>Yet withall I muſt tell him, that his ſatisfaction of the objection is unſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and not we, but himſelf will be found guilty of falſe ſurmiſes about Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication and Suſpenſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:169758:58"/>And here I value not what the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſurmiſes, ſince Mr. <hi>H.</hi> may frame it as he pleaſe, and ſo make it ſurmiſe what he will: but if thereby he intends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that <hi>we look at Church Diſcipline as lying ſolely in Suſpenſion,</hi> I muſt tell him, he acts not the part of a fair reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. 1. Therefore for negative Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (which is a bare non-admiſſion) we account it no part of Church Diſcipline, no more then himſelf doth the non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Infants or mad folk. 2. For poſitive Suſpenſion (whereby 1. Perſons upon triall found unworthy by the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip. 2. Perſons who obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe triall, yet will obtrude themſelves upon the Sacrament, are by vote of the Elderſhip denied participation) this we ſay is an act of Church Diſcipline, and a leſſer degree of Excommunication, whereof I conceive there is a threefold degree, 1. From private communion, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14. 2. Not onely from private but alſo from Sacramentall Communion, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Eating</hi> there being extended to Sacramentall eating as well as dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall eating; as is cleared by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaeriſt in his Vindication or Anſwer to <hi>Suſpenſion ſuſpended,</hi> to which therefore
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169758:59"/>I refer. 3. From Church memberſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17, 18. &amp; 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</p>
               <p>Yet withall I adde, this poſitive ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion is not iſſued out againſt any, unleſs by their obſtinacy they force the Elderſhip to it. For 1. if a perſon upon triall be found ignorant, the Elderſhip doth not preſently proceed to Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but intreat him to forbear a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or two, till he have attained to ſome competency of knowledge, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto they give him direction, and offer him their aſſiſtance. If for all this he thruſt himſelf upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they deſire him to forbear, and tell him they dare not admit him till more capable. And laſtly, if all this will not ſerve, they are forced to iſſue out a Vote of Suſpenſion, which yet I believe is very rare, ſince too many ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend themſelves by keeping away becauſe they will not be tried. 2. If a perſon be found ſcandalous, they admoniſh him being before them, if he profeſs repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and be willing to give ſatisfaction, they dare not refuſe him: otherwiſe they proceed with him as with the former after conviction. And if the ſin and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall be great, and aggravated by obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169758:59"/>they proceed not onely to Suſpenſion, but alſo to diſmemberſhip. Having given this account of out judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, let us weigh Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement about Church Cenſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. He ſaith, <hi>They are puniſhments upon ſcandalous perſons (after a legall conviction) whereby they are debarred from Chriſtian ſociety in generall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In this deſcription he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes amiſs, by omitting one main end of Church Cenſures, namely the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the party cenſured, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſtrayning them onely to ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons as to practice, which are extendible to any wilfull ſinner; and if perſons wilfully ignorant be not wilfull ſinners, I know not who are, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In debarring perſons cenſured of all Chriſtian ſociety in generall. And here I challenge Maſter <hi>Humphrey</hi> and all the world to ſhew me any one place in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which requires that perſons excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated ſhould not be preſent at any publick Ordinance. I grant, that by Excommunication they are made as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Publicanes, and are <hi>in ſtatus quo</hi> no Church members, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. but I ſee no place that proves perſons out of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169758:60"/>the Church may not be preſent at any publick Ordinance. I am ſure 1
<hi>Corinth.</hi> 14.24, favours the contrary. He is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much miſtaken about us, who neither ſhut the Church doores nor the Chancell doores againſt any perſon cenſured, but admit them to be preſent at all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; nor do we believe their preſence will leaven any, ſince ſpirituall defilement is not contracted by preſence, but by connivance or imitation, &amp;c. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any gratifie profane perſons, it muſt be they who exclude from all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, not we who admit them to be preſent at all Ordinances, though we reſtrain them from actuall receiving, and that upon very weighty reaſons, yet withall let me tell Mr.
<hi>Humphrey</hi> that he is miſtaken in ſaying, pag. 32. <hi>That profane perſons never care to come to the Sacrament.</hi> Did he never hear of poor ignorant and profane creatures, that muſt needs come and eat their Maker at <hi>Eaſter</hi> eſpecially? or is he onely a ſtranger in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and knows not theſe things? May not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and profane ones deſire the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment partly out of cuſtome and faſhion, partly becauſe they apprehend its a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace for them to be turned away, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169758:60"/>for many ſuch triviall grounds?</p>
               <p>For his ſecond ſnrmiſe, pag. 32. <hi>That Suſpenſion is inſtituted onely in reference to the Ordinances, to keep them pure and holy, if the Sacrament eſpecially would he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied otherwiſe to the Receivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We think the Ordinances are defiled onely to thoſe who uſe them ſinfully. 2. That perſons are defiled not by preſence with unworthy Receivers, but by partaking in their ſins. 3. That they partake in the ſins of unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, who do not their duty to reform them, or to keep them from receiving in caſe they will not be reformed.</p>
               <p>Its therefore falſe which he aſſerts, pag. 32. <hi>That Church Cenſures concern not thoſe who are admitted to the Ordinances, but are uſed in reference onely to offenders,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For 1. It concerns all Church members in their places to look to it, that Church Cenſures be duly executed. 2. Their very execution doth much concern Church members, by fear to keep then from thoſe inordinate courſes which bring Church Cenſures upon others. And its conſiderable how he contradicts himſelf in the cloſe of this paragraph, when he makes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;

                  </gap> to be the ends of Church Cenſures. And I appeal to all the world, whether admonition (which better ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſenſe of the firſt Greek word) ſatisfying the Congregation, and warning or example, concern more of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation but the parties offending?</p>
               <p>His third pretended ſurmiſe is, That we conceive <hi>there is a moſt neer eſſentiall relation between this Excommunication and the Communion, as if it were a part of it, at leaſt ſome neceſſary antecedent, as if the Sacrament could not be adminiſtred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Objection it ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>pag.</hi> 30. and elevated to the height of Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his deſign, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no ſuch mad conſequence. For grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it were a truth, that free admiſſion did takeaway the uſe of the Keyes, &amp;c. how doth it follow from thence, that there is an eſſentiall relation between Excommunication and the Communion? or (which is more groſs) that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is a part of the Communion? Do not
<hi>eſſentialiter relata</hi> put or take away each other? but doth the taking away of Excommunication take away the Communion? what is this, but to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169758:61"/>conclude that the admitting of all ſorts to the Communion takes away the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? So belike there is a Communion which all partake of, and yet there is no Communion becauſe all partake of it. Is not this excellent Logick? The Sun ſhines which all men ſee, and yet it doth not ſhine becauſe all men ſee it. Its therefore both a falſe inference and an abſurd fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in it ſelf, that there is an eſſentiall relation between Excommunication and the Coram union, ſince the Communion may be without Excommunication, and Excommunication without the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. (I ſpeak as to matter of fact, not as to <hi>jus</hi> or
<hi>fas,</hi> for I believe all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances ſhould be maintained in the Church, yet withall that the abſence of one Ordinance doth not null another.) There is indeed a neer relation between the Communion and Excommunication in point of duty, ſince we muſt not ſeparate thoſe things which God hath joyned (God having commanded all his Ordinances to be uſed) but not in point of being or exiſtence, ſince they depend not ſo one upon the other, that all muſt needs be aboliſhed if one be univerſally neglected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:169758:62"/>The latter ſurmiſe framed by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is farre more abſurd, as if either we or the objection by him propounded <hi>made Excommunication a part of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> What is this but a contradiction <hi>in terminis,</hi> to make keeping from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament a part of the Sacrament, or keeping from receiving a part of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving! From ſuch receiving we ſhall ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend no unworthy perſon. We wiſh Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> much good with ſuch contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, but deſire him not to pin them upon our ſleeve. 2. How follows it from the Objection that Excommunication is a part of Communion? The Argument muſt ſtand thus, If free admiſſion to the Communion excommunicate Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, then Excommunication is a part of the Communion; but free admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth ſo. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Do not the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and the Conſequent here hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like ropes of ſand? Is it not rather true, that if free admiſſion to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion excommunicate Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then Excommunication is no part of the Communion? Is it not againſt nature for one part to excommunicate another?</p>
               <p>His diſtinction between acts of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169758:62"/>and acts of Worſhip makes little for his purpoſe. We grant them indeed to be diſtinct things; yet withall we adde, that acts of Diſcipline are no bars to acts of Worſhip, excepting onely actuall receiving in the Sacrament; (If he pleaſe to call that an act of Worſhip) I muſt therefore paſs his following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <hi>pag.</hi> 33. &amp; 34. as wholly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and tell him, that the friends of Suſpenſion are more both for Diſcipline and Worſhip then he is. 1. Becauſe we are for all the parts and degrees of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, he is onely for ſome of them. 2. We exclude no excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from any part of publick Worſhip but only from actuall receiving; <hi>Contra,</hi> he excludes all excommunicate perſons from all publick acts of Worſhip, <hi>pag.</hi> 31.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Object. <hi>The moſt of men are wholly unfit, and not capable of this Ordinance, as wanting both the preparatory and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part, &amp;c. therefore no free admiſſion hither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I commend Mr. <hi>H.</hi> who will be ſure to chooſe Adverſaries weak enough: He may well ſay there is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt weakneſs in this Argument. But he doth ill to right againſt our weakeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169758:63"/>and then triumph as if we had no ſtronger.</p>
               <p>We have ſhewed formerly, That fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or unfitneſs abſolutely conſidered is no rule for the Churches admiſſion or ſuſpenſion, but either of theſe as viſible. We ſay not, that all who are unfit muſt be kept from the Sacrament, but onely all who are viſibly unfit. 2. That for the diſcerning of thoſe who are viſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, the Church muſt proceed by a rule to finde them out. 3. That triall by examination of perſons, and witneſs if need be, is a Scripture and approved rule. 4. That all are bound to ſubmit either to publick or private triall, as God offers occaſion for either, when it may be for Gods glory and their own or others edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yea though it ſhould tend to their outward prejudice, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. 5. That being discovered to be unfit, they ought to repent and ſtudy to be fit, but not to thruſt themſelves againſt light and conviction upon the Sacrament, When God ſaies, <hi>Let a man ſo cat,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.28. how dares any man ſay, Let him eat though not ſo? 6. If notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons viſibly unfit will thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Sacrament, its the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169758:63"/>duty not to let them eat and drink judgement to themſelves, by murdering the Lord of glory, unleſs Mr. <hi>H.</hi> be of <hi>Cains</hi> Religion, that Church Officers are not their brethrens keepers, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 4.9. Neither let him object, That then they may as well keep him from hearing, &amp;c. for in part it hath, and (God willing) ſhall be more fully ſhewed, that there is a wide difference between hearing and receiving.</p>
               <p>Now let's hear what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath to ſay againſt this Objection of his own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>And firſt I thank him that <hi>pag</hi> 35. he laies down, <hi>That the Church can but look upon an outward capacity.</hi> He might have added (ſince <hi>contrariorum eadem eſt ratio</hi>) That the Church may alſo look upon and judge of outward incapacity, but ſee and judge of it they cannot without evidence and triall; therefore 3. They may enquire after perſons capable or uncapable. 4. Since triall is in vain without execution, therefore they ought to admit all perſons outwardly capable, and ſuſpend all perſons outwardly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; otherwiſe how ſhall they ſuſpend (negatively at leaſt) Infants, diſtracted
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169758:64"/>and excommunicated perſons?</p>
               <p>As to his three Anſwers, I anſwer briefly, 1. A naturall man muſt hear, pray, &amp;c. though he cannot do them rightly, becauſe theſe are converting Ordinances, ſo is not the Lords Supper, I mean as to actuall receiving; he may therefore hear, &amp;c. but not receive. <hi>I wonder a wiſe man ſhould</hi> miſtake a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for <hi>a feather.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Its true, every man muſt do what he can: but many things are naturally poſſible which are morally impoſſible; and thus I cannot do that which I may not, that is impoſſible which is unlawfull. Let him prove that actuall receiving is a debt on the part of a naturall man, or that to admit a perſon viſibly unworthy is a debt on the Churches part, and we ſhall be far enough from hindering any in the payment of their debts either to God or man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In his laſt Anſwer, though he have borrowed a good diſtinction from Maſter
<hi>Pemble,</hi> yet he ſhuffles wofully in the application of it. In a legall ſenſe no man is either worthy, or receives wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; in an Evangelicall ſenſe no man receives worthily, but he is a worthy
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169758:64"/>Receiver, But I ask Mr. <hi>H.</hi> whether he dares apply either branch of this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all whom he admits ſo freely? To come to his own words, Do all that he admits. 1. Labour their beſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their hearts. 2. Judge and humble themſelves really before God. 3. Come to Chriſt heavy laden. 4. Look at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as dogs, and yet importune Chriſt for the crums of mercy? I ſay then he hath the worthieſt Congregation in the world. 2. All his Communicants are not onely worthy, bun eminently godly. But now to retort. How eaſie were it to evince the contrary againſt moſt whom he would have admitted. For 1. How many ignorant ones are therein our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, that ſcarce know their right hands from their left in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. 2. How many profane ones, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, drunkards, &amp;c. 3. How many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly pious, who upon triall might eaſily be uncaſed, to live in ſome known ſin. Each of theſe fearing (and that not without cauſe) to be uncaſed before the Elderſhip, no wonder they are ſo averſe to triall, leſt their ſheeps cloathing ſhould be pull'd off, and themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be ignorant, profane, or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169758:65"/>criticall, far enough from the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned graces of humility, repentance, and faith. If he object that ſuch perſons ſhould be excommunicated, I anſwer, 1. Whoever deſerve Excommunication, do much more deſerve Suſpenſion; and it ſeems then, that the Presbyterians of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend rather in being too favourable then too rigid. 2. We deny not, but in caſe of obſtinacy or foul ſcandall, diſmembring may follow Suſpenſion, the greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication the leſſer. 3. I hope Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is more charitable then to profeſs that all ignorant perſons ſhould be excommunicated. I am ſure we are ſo charitable, as by Suſpenſion to put them upon endeavours after knowledge, that they may be fitted for, and ſo comfortably admitted to the Sacrament, Which his free admiſſion is not like to do; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to harden and flatter them in their ignorance.</p>
               <p>He notes well, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. That on the unworthy receivers part, <hi>the Ordinance is taken in vain, againſt the third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But whereas he adds, <hi>not ſo on the admitters part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The admitters having regularly the power of the Keyes, if they admit
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169758:65"/>perſons viſibly unworthy, are acceſſary to their guilt; as any one is an acceſſary in Gods account, who prevents not the ſin of his neighbour when he hath power to do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Object. <hi>Holy things to holy men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> I may ſay of this as of the former, There is little ſtrength in it. Yet withall, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Anſwer falls ſhort, and is too too feeble likewiſe. For 1. All outward holy things are not to be adminiſtred to all outwardly holy perſons, ſince Infants and diſtracted perſons (if Chriſtians) are outwardly (yea divers of them inwardly) holy, yet by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his vote are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the Sacrament. 2. Some things outwardly holy may be adminiſtred to perſons not ſo much as outwardly holy by profeſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. 3. What is bare profeſſion if contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by profaneſs? That which cannot ſecure a man from Excommunication, but rather makes him capable of it, much leſs can ſecure him againſt Suſpenſion, an inferiour Cenſure. But ſuch is bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion if accompanied with profaneſs. 4. Many perſons excommunicated do ſtill profeſs, and ſo are outwardly holy, yet theſe Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have excluded from
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169758:66"/>all Ordinances. From all which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, 1. That M. <hi>H.</hi> his Anſwer may vye with the Objection for weakneſſe. 2. That M. <hi>H.</hi> here as well as other where contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf, in ſaying that the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the ſame time muſt be admitted to all the Ordinances, and yet he muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to none of the Ordinances; to all the Ordinances as a profeſſor, to none of the Ordinances as excommunicated; a cruel aſſertion and a flat contradiction.</p>
               <p>For the Reply <hi>pag.</hi> 38, &amp; 39. <hi>Do we not hereby make our ſelves one with the wicked with whom we joyn and ſo have communion with Belial?</hi> His anſwer is good, <hi>That joyning with a wicked mans perſon is not having communion with Belial, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying of him in his evil wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our difference here with M. <hi>H.</hi> is not ſo much about joyning with the wicked, as accompanying of him in his evil wayes: It being firſt his ſin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive unworthily; Secondly, The peoples ſin who know him to be unworthy and do not inform the Church: Thirdly, The Churches fault if they ſtudy not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of perſons unworthy, or admit them to the Sacrament when viſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: Nor is preſence with the wicked
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169758:66"/>at Ordinances, but foſtering of them in their ſins, communion with Belial, which I wiſh too many do not fall into by this free admiſſion, pleaded for with more ſtrength of affection then power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>
               <p>We eaſily agree with him, <hi>That wicked perſons in the Church, are in ſome ſenſe in Chriſt and ſanctified by him:</hi> But if this be enough for admiſſion to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then why doth himſelf ſhut the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel door (as he other where calls it) againſt Infants arid mad men, who are as much if not more in Chriſt, and as much if not more ſanctified then the former, and againſt whom himſelf dares not ſhut the Church door. Therefore ſay I, if M. <hi>H.</hi> be really for free admiſſion, let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded none out of the Chancel that are within die Church. For the places of Scripture that he quotes <hi>page</hi> 40. I am confident the Orthodox interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, will never open the Chancel to groſly ignorant or prophane Church-members; the latter of which are ſo far from having right to be admitted into the Chancel, that they deſerve to be ſhut out of the Church.</p>
               <p>To cloſe up this third Objection: How
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169758:67"/>groſſe is that aſſertion <hi>pag.</hi> 41. <hi>That there is an hiſtoricall viſible faith, that gives an outward Church-right unto the Elements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For then firſt excommunicated perſons have a right to the Elements, who though caſt out for their prophaneneſſe, have ſtill an hiſtoricall faith, ſince excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not deprive you of their hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall faith, yet cuts them off 1. from viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church-memberſhip, 2. from viſible Chriſt-memberſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saving faith it ſelf doth not alwayes give a right to the Elements (it being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a godly man for ſome foul ſcandall may be excommunicated) much leſſe then doth viſible hiſtoricall faith, when contradicted eſpecially by cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prophaneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As hiſtoricall faith gives not a right to Chriſt (for that the devils have,
<hi>Iames</hi> 2.19.) but the faith of adheſion ſeated in the will not in the underſtanding, ſo not viſible hiſtoricall faith, but viſible faith of adheſion gives a Church-right to Chriſt ſacramentall, and ſhould any man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe hiſtoricall faith but proteſt againſt faith of adheſion, I appeal to M. <hi>H.</hi> his conſcience, whether he durſt admit ſuch a wretch to the Sacrament. For my own
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169758:67"/>part,, ſhould any perſon profeſſe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God, the only Saviour and Mediator between God and man, but I will not reſt upon him for righteouſneſſe and ſalvation; let this man be never ſo pious outwardly, I ſhould ſooner admit a common adulterer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then him.</p>
               <p>Objection 4. <hi>page</hi> 41. <hi>The Seal is ſet to a blank if be admitted.</hi>

                  <hi>An.</hi> 1. For underſtanding this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the better, we muſt know, that what the Philoſopher ſaid in generall, that <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma eſt raſa tabula,</hi> is too true of all men ſince the fall in order unto ſaving grace. They are <hi>Tabulae,</hi> as capable of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits writing; they are <hi>raſae tabulae,</hi> which notes 1. They are naturally deſtitute of this writing. 2. This writing was raſed out by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and thus all men naturally are blanks, in order to the writing of the new Covenant in their hearts: The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude you have
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Blank is either viſible or invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. To God all blanks are viſible, and he may uſe his liberty to ſet his ſeal where he pleaſes, by commanding to baptiſe all Infants of beleeving parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to admit to the Lords Supper all viſible
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169758:68"/>Saints that are Church-members.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is then, Whether man may apply the Seals to viſible blanks. It's clear he may not; for then Heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before inſtruction and profeſſion, as alſo their Infants might be baptiſed. I aſſume, But there are viſible blanks in the Church as well as in the world, namely perſons that are as notoriouſly ignorant and profane as Heathen, and who if they had not been baptiſed in their infancy, ſhould not be now admitted to baptiſm, without evidence firſt given of their knowledge and piety. Therefore ſay I, ſeeing (according to M. <hi>H.</hi> his own rule) <hi>Adultis eadem eſt ratio utriuſ<expan>
                        <am>

The Objection thus ſtated we conceive to be good: Lets ſee now what M. <hi>H.</hi> hath to object againſt it. I ſhall at preſent paſſe his firſt diſtinction as waved yet by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Page 41, and 42. <hi>He conceive it's a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall miſtake, that people take the Sacrament to be a Seal to their faith, and if there be m true faith, that it is ſet (they think) to a blanks.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:169758:68"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Sacramentall ſeals (as others) relate either to parties or to things. 1. To parties, namely the Covenanters on both parts, God and the creature in Covenant; from God to the creature they ſeal the Covenant of grace, from the creature to God they ſeal dutifulneſſe and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Here we ſay, the Church cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſeals of the Covenant to any who are viſibly out of the Covenant; but in our Congregations there are many groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant and prophane perſons viſibly out of the Covenant. You will ſay, they are viſibly in the Covenant as Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members and profeſſors though at large; True, but their viſible profeſſion is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to their viſible ignorance and prophaneneſſe, no more then profeſſion of honeſty is to open cheating: as a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uncaſed loſes the repute and priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of an honeſt man, ſo an hypocrite uncaſed forfeits the priviledges of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the Church both may and ought to take the forfeiture, till the breach made upon his profeſſion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by a new profeſſion of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and promiſe of reformation, yea and viſible reformation too, ſo far as it can be had: and certainty, if ſuch a perſon may
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169758:69"/>be denied all publike Ordinances (in M. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement) much more may he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied one Ordinance. He that deſerves the greater penalty, much more deſerves the leſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To come neerer to his Anſwer: Sacramentall Seals relate to things as well as to perſons: And thus as Seals, 1. They confirm the Covenant. 2. They confirm the faith of the worthy receiver. 3. They confirm judgement to the unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. To apply the diſtinction: 1. All ſorts may be preſent to ſee the Covenant ſealed. 2. None but perſons Evangelically worthy may partake, theſe only having faith to be confirmed. 3. None viſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy may by the Church be admitted to partake, as being viſibly without faith, either in the habit or actings thereof; which laſt I note in reference to godly perſons who ſometimes may be juſtly either ſuſpended or excommunicated. 4. Suppoſing they may be admitted on the Miniſters part where the power of the Keyes is imperfect, yet to clear his own ſoul the Miniſter is to deal plainly with every unworthy receiver, and let him know that he will but betray and murther Chriſt, as our Saviour did to <hi>Iudas</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169758:69"/>he did receive,) and that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which confirms other mens faith, will confirm his unbelief and ſeal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto him. To ſumme up all: That which confirms or ratifies is tropically a Seal; but the Sacrament doth confirm faith and ratifie the Covenant to faith, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Its both a ſeal of faith, and a ſeal to faith; <hi>&amp; contra,</hi> where there is no faith to confirm, as to that particular it muſt needs ſeal to a blank, as ſealing to a blank is a known expreſſion to note the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſeal to a paper that hath no writings, and where nothing is writ there nothing can be confirmed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Sacrament ſeals Chriſts bloud in particular for pardon to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers by vertue of its primitive inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is evident by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. with
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22.20. The latter place ſaith, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my bloud which is ſhed for you:</hi> the former place ſheweth for what end, namely <hi>for remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The language then of the Sacrament given to every receiver is; the body and bloud of Chriſt is thine for the remiſſion of thy ſins, and how dares any Miniſter ſay or ſeal this to a perſon known to be groſly ignorant or profane?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:169758:70"/>Pag. 42. <hi>God doth not atteſt our faith, but the truth of his own promiſes, but the Sacraments are Seals properly of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I know none ſo ſimple as to aſſert that God doth <hi>in terminis</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, the Sacrament doth not ſay in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres terms thou <hi>Roger</hi> beleeveſt, no more then the word doth, but only by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note> atteſt our faith in the Sacrament, as M. <hi>H.</hi> ſeems to inſinuate; the Sacrament doth not ſo atteſt but ſuppoſe and require faith, and then ſeals the Covenant to faith. 2. In vain doth it ſeal the Covenant, if to no perſons: A Covenant cannot be but with ſome body, and if it be ſealed it muſt be ſealed to thoſe with whom it is made: therefore the Covenant being ſealed in the Sacrament, it muſt be ſealed to ſome body, and ſealed regularly it cannot be to thoſe who viſibly reject it: but groſly ignorant and prophane perſons uncaſed, do viſibly reject the Covenant of grace,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the Covenant of grace cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly be applied to them by the Seals. 3. If the Sacraments are ſeals properly of the Covenant, why may not Infants and diſtracted perſons partake of them, who have a more viſible right to it then groſly ignorant and prophane perſons have? 4. As the Sacraments are ſeals of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſo they may be applied to the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169758:70"/>Covenant before all, but the Covenant may not by them be applied or ſealed to any but to perſons viſibly worthy. Its well therefore in the ſame page he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects himſelf, and grants <hi>the Sacraments may be ſeals of our faith</hi> conſecutivè,
<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they confirm and ſtrengthen faith:</hi> But he ſhuffles in ſaying, <hi>They are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter, and in a true and proper ſenſe ſeales unto any thing but the Covenant.</hi> In a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe a ſeal is an artificiall thing fit to make a viſible repreſentation or impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and confirmation. This the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not properly but figuratively to the Covenant it ſelf, namely as it hath the office of a ſeal, which is to repreſent and confirm, and this it doth to faith as well as to the Covenant: For 1. As it repreſents the Covenant, it muſt needs repreſent faith as an eſpeciall branch promiſed in the Covenant. 2. As it confirms the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſo it confirms faith gradually of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and promiſed in it, and thereby alſo confirms faith inherent in the worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, as a Bond ſealed unto me confirms my belief that the particulars ſealed unto ſhall be performed, and if this be not to ſeal in a formal and proper ſenſe (theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically) I know not what is. And thus
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169758:71"/>increaſe of faith and all other graces are ſealed by the Sacrament to the worthy receiver, but neither the beginnings nor increaſe of faith are ſealed to the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver.</p>
               <p>Nor will his inſtance of Circumciſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 43. help him as to the point in hand, ſince Circumciſion was applied to none but viſible Saints, either by Covenant, election, or by actuall profeſſion, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by living in ſcandalous ſins, or notorious ignorance of the Covenant of grace, which is the rule we walk by in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or non-admiſſion.</p>
               <p>And as little advantage will his cauſe gain by his illuſtration (here again repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) drawn from a Proclamation ſealed and offered to rebels that refuſe it. True, the ſimilitude holds in ſome particulars: 1. The Covenant of grace is proclaimed by the Miniſter. 2. The truth of it is ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sacrament. 3. The benefits of it offered to all, and therefore we deny not but all ſorts may be preſent at the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as all rebels whether obſtinate or ſubmiſſive may be preſent at the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſealing of a Pardon. But what is offering a ſealed Pardon in generall and conditionally, to the particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169758:71"/>and ſealing of the ſame Pardon to ſingular perſons? Or how can a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner without breach of his truſt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (either by word of mouth or ſeal.) pardon to a Traytor that viſibly ſtands out againſt his Prince? In like manner at the Sacrament, not only the Elements do repreſent and ſeal the Covenant of grace as to its truth in generall, but ſome of the Sacramentall actions (as giving and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) do particularly apply it to every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver: And how dares any Miniſter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving regular power to deny it, by word and ſeal apply the Covenant of grace to any perſon that viſibly rejects it? To il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this by the initiall Sacrament; Baptiſm when ever adminiſtred, ſeals the Covenant of grace as well as the Lords Supper; but only to the perſon baptized doth it make particular application of the Covenant, and therefore cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any unbaptized perſon that is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly out of the Covenant, be he born of Heathen or of Chriſtian Parents: But all who are viſibly in the ſtate of nature are viſibly out of the Covenant, and ſuch are groſly ignorant, and ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons willfully perſiſting in both. Since therefore both Sacraments ſeal one and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169758:72"/>the ſame Covenant, he who ſhould not be admitted to the firſt were he unbaptized, muſt not <hi>pari ratione</hi> be admitted to the ſecond though baptized.</p>

God will not Miniſters ſhould deliver precious pearls to ſuch ſwine.</p>
               <p>What he addes <hi>Pag.</hi> 45. is alſo weak, in which reſpect he doth well to cover the nakedneſſe of it with a blinde and miſty parentheſis. His words are theſe: <hi>As they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169758:72"/>are Gods ſeals, for the ſame reaſon they cannot be ſeals of faith, becauſe God ſeals not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginably to our part of the Covenant which is faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Both the aſſertion it ſelf and its reaſon are falſe. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, Are they not Gods ſeals, 1. As relating to Gods Covenant. 2. As inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God himſelf to ratifie his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Is not faith it ſelf and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſaving grace promiſed in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? unleſſe M. <hi>H.</hi> will profeſſedly turn Pelagian, and make faith only the birth of mans free-will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If the Covenant be Gods, if the ſeal be Gods, and faith promiſed in it be Gods alſo, is it not apparent that Gods ſeal muſt needs be faiths ſeal alſo? Not a ſeal from faith authoritatively as from God, but a ſeal of faith as a branch of the Covenant promiſed, and as a ſeal to faith actually laying hold on the Covenant. If the Covenant of grace undertake not for our part of the Covenant, we are in a worſe condition now under the Covenant of grace then we were under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, ſince then <hi>Adam</hi> had perfection of grace to back free-will; but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169758:73"/>in fallen man free-will either hath no grace inherent, or but weak grace to act it, and impoſſible were it for any either to convert or perſevere, unleſſe God under-took both for the infuſion and ſupporting of grace.</p>

                  </label> If faith and grace be a part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that is ſealed by the Sacrament, then the beſt way were free admiſſion, that the Covenant, and ſo faith it ſelf may be ſealed to all.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Not ſo: For 1. Though the Covenant offer grace to all conditionally, yet it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth not grace abſolutely to any but the elect and perſons effectually called: to the firſt it promiſeth initiall grace, to the latter it promiſeth progreſſe and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in grace. Now the ſeal can ſecure no more then what is in the writing: but ſaving grace is not abſolutely promiſed to all, in the Covenant, <hi>ergò</hi> it cannot be ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all in the Sacrament. The offer of grace indeed is ſealed to all preſent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they receive it or no; but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace can be ſealed to none but the Legatees of the new Covenant, and ſuch are only perſons elected or effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, underſtand me here as to the ſpirituall and ſaving branches of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169758:73"/>and that is done on Gods part e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for the Church and the Miniſter, who cannot judge infallibly who are elected and effectually called, they muſt proceed by the rule of viſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſealing the promiſes by the Sacrament, to them and them only who upon juſt triall tempered with charity appear to be viſible Legatees. And as Chriſt himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects not good words and outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion when contradicted by our carriage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. no more muſt the Church when mens carriage doth viſibly contradict their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Lords Supper being a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of nouriſhment, ſeals not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly initiall, but progreſſive grace; nor can the Church apply it for converſion but edification: and how are they capable of edification in grace who are deſtitute of all grace, or of viſible edification who are deſtitute of viſible grace?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the Lords Supper, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctification but alſo the comforts of the Covenant are ſealed to the receivers, but how can the comforts of holineſſe be ſealed to unholy perſons, or by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter applied to thoſe who are viſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.19, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:169758:74"/>Pag. 46. He ſpeaks clearly and truly, <hi>That an unregenerate man cannot receive the Sacrament as a ſeal of his faith.</hi> For how can faith be ſealed to where it is not? But what follows immediately, <hi>Yet the Church can give it as a ſeal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> is either ambiguous or falſe;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous if he take giving for giving out or holding forth, for thus Chriſt may be given to all, whether they receive or no; but this is nothing to his purpoſe, and proves onely that all may be preſent, but not that all may receive. Its falſe if underſtood of the delivery of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all perſons who may be preſent. 1. In Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his ſenſe, who cannot Scripturally or rationally exclude either Infants, diſtracted or excommunicated perſons from preſence, yet will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them actually to receive. 2. Its falſe in our ſenſe, who can admit either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or ſcandalous perſons to be preſent, but neither of them to receive.</p>
               <p>His illuſtration <hi>ibid.</hi> drawn from the Word preached, makes againſt him if rightly ſtated. <hi>True, there may be true preaching , though the hearers apply not the Word by faith.</hi> But can there be true preaching, where the Miniſter applies
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169758:74"/>the Word wrong, binding where he ſhould looſe, and looſing where he ſhould binde with the Key of Doctrine? No more doth that Miniſter do his duty, who in the Lords Supper looſes where he ſhould binde, and ſeals comfort to him who is not a viſible Saint.</p>

He ſpeaks darkly and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guouſly, as if he would make us believe they were not mans ſeales becauſe they are Gods ſeales; by which Logick he might as well prove the Sabbath were not mans becauſe it is Gods, and the Goſpel were not mans becauſe it is Gods, yea that nothing were mans becauſe all things were Gods, as if humane propriety contradicted Divine Supremacy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he mean the Sacraments are not mans ſeals by inſtitution, That is true, but nothing to his purpoſe. The broad ſeal is not mine by inſtitution, yet I may truly ſay the broad ſeal is mine, when I have a patent or pardon ſealed by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth not the finall cauſe give as true propriety as the efficient, nay uſually
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169758:75"/>more? A ſeal, a ſuit, an houſe, &amp;c. is more his for whom it is made, then his that makes it. God indeed hath a double propriety in the Sacrament, as made both by him and for him, namely to ſeal his Covenant, &amp;c. but it being made for man alſo, man hath a true propriety in it, as he for whom either a ſeal or a meal is made, hath in both. Its ridiculous therefore he would ſeem at leaſt to aſſert, The Sacraments are not mans ſeals, and yet grant pag. 47. <hi>They are mans ſeals in uſe.</hi> Doth he not know that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>extra uſum</hi> hath no being, and ſo is neither Gods ſeal nor mans ſeal? and that in uſe it is both Gods ſeal and mans ſeal, a ſeal from God to man, and from man to God?</p>
               <p>The Covenant indeed ſtands ſealed by God to ail conditionally, <hi>but will that acquit the Church in delivering the ſigns to all,</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would have it <hi>pag.</hi> 47. Then why may not even Heathen or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated perſons receive, to whom the Covenant is offered and ſealed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally?</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>That the tenour of the Goſpel is ſealed abſolutely by the Sacrament, but not our intereſt in it,</hi> as he notes in the ſame
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169758:75"/>page, is true in the firſt branch, but falſe in the ſecond, ſince not onely the tenour of the Covenant is ſealed abſolutely to the worthy Receiver, but alſo his intereſt in it. 2. To thoſe who are viſibly worthy, the Miniſter ſeals their viſible intereſt; which viſible intereſt, becauſe ſome in the Church have not, therefore the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter cannot ſeal it to them by giving them the Elements, but by conſecration and application of the Sacrament to others before their eyes, doth ſeal even to the ſtanders by the tenour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the Lords Supper, as well as in Baptiſme. In both Sacraments the offer of grace is ſealed to all, yea even to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then &amp;c. but reall intereſt is ſealed only to reall Saints and worthy Receivers, as viſible intereſt to viſible Saints.</p>
               <p>Grant <hi>the Word ſpeaks not particularly of any mans ſingle intereſt by name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet it doth by ſignes, and whoſoever findes thoſe ſignes in himſelf, hath as true an intereſt in the Covenant, as if he were mentioned in it by name. The Scripture faith not particularly of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that he ſhall riſe at the day of judgement, yet I hope Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> doubts not of his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in particular: nor doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169758:76"/>ſay Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhall be ſaved, yet if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> have ſaving faith, it doth as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aſſure him of ſalvation, as if he were mentioned by name, &amp;c. Now the ſeals run parallel with the Covenant, and aſſure conditionall ſalvation to all, viſible ſalvation to viſible Saints, reall ſalvation to reall Saints, to the firſt by the outward adminiſtration, to the ſecond by viſible application, to the third by reall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall application.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore <hi>page</hi> 48. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pleaſeth himſelf with this Embryon of his own brain, which being formerly conceived by <hi>a piercing and godly man converted his opinion,</hi> as he ſaies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">And, if I miſtake not, this piercing godly man is far from Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his judgment of free admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I hope that godly perſon (if ſo) was converted before Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Embryon was hatched. 2. I ſee little of converſion or piety in admitting all pell mell to the Sacrament. 3.

               <p>For further confirmation, <hi>pag.</hi> 48. he propounds the tenour of the Covenant
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169758:76"/>in a ſyllogiſm, thus, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved;</hi> adde,
<hi>I believe,</hi> Ergo, <hi>I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Then he denies that the Sacrament ſeals either the minor or the concluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Sacrament ſeals what the Covenant of grace promiſes, but the Covenant of grace promiſes (and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offers) ſalvation to particular perſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9.
<hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> This is evident by the promiſe of ſalvation to believers in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>John</hi>
3.16. What is promiſed to a whole kinde, is promiſed to every particular of that kinde. Let Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> tell me how the Sacrament ſeals the offer of grace to him in particular, and I will tell him how it may alſo ſeal the promiſe of grace or ſalvation to him or any elſe in particular. Where is it ſaid in Scripture, I offer to thee <hi>John Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> Miniſter of
<hi>Froome,</hi> &amp;c. grace and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt; will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> yet deny the offer of grace is made as particularly to him, as if he had been named in Scripture? Or where is it ſaid, Thou <hi>John Humphrey</hi> ſhalt not commit adultery, &amp;c. yet doth not that command reach him as particularly as if he were named? He that ſaies, <hi>Omnis homo eſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169758:77"/>animal rationale,</hi> doth he not as truly ſay that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is
<hi>Animal rationale,</hi> as if he had mentioned him by name? In like manner, when the Scripture ſaies, <hi>All that believe ſhall be ſaved,</hi> doth it not ſay, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> believing ſhall be ſaved? If therefore Mr. <hi>H. de facto</hi> do believe, it promiſes ſalvation as particularly to him as if he were mentioned by name; or that I believing ſhall be ſaved, as if my name were in the promiſe. Where the condition is performed, there the promiſe is abſolute; but when I believe, the condition is performed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the promiſe, That I ſhall be ſaved, is abſolute. This premiſed, I reſume, What the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant promiſeth, that the Sacrament ſeals. The Covenant promiſes that I ſhall be ſaved in particular,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeals that I ſhall be ſaved in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: But this is the concluſion which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> denied to be ſealed by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Next for the minor of his ſyllogiſme namely, That <hi>I believe,</hi> I ſhall prove againſt him, that this is alſo ſealed in the Sacrament, not to all Receivers, but to all worthy Receivers, thus, as formerly, What the Covenant enſures, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169758:77"/>ſeals; the Covenant aſſures me that I believe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sacrament ſeals to me that I believe. The minor, which onely is queſtionable, I prove thus: That which gives to me clear evidence that I believe, that aſſures me I believe. The Covenant gives me clear evidence that I believe; <hi>Ergo.</hi> The minor is good, becauſe the Covenant affords infallible ſignes and evidences of faith in what heart ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is; and ſo of faith in my heart particularly, or in any other heart what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. As therefore by the properties of a man, I may know my ſelf to be a man, ſo by the properties of faith held forth in the Covenant, I may know my ſelf to have faith. That Goſpel which ſaies, He who receives Chriſt for righteouſneſs, &amp;c. believes, the ſame Goſpel ſaies, That I receiving Chriſt for righteouſneſs do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and ſo by conſequence it faith abſolutely, that I believe. But what the Covenant affirms, that the Sacrament ſeals or ratifies; namely, that I believe in particular. And this is the minor which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> denies to be ſealed by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>For clearer explication, conſider that the minor or aſſumption of the Syllogiſm
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169758:78"/>of aſſurance depends partly upon faith, and partly upon ſenſe or experience; upon faith, that the evidence is right <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> and not a falſe evidence; upon ſenſe or experience, <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> that this right evidence is in me. For as a falſe evidence in me, ſo a right evidence without me, are both equally null and invalid as to aſſurance. For example, Would I know my faith is right, and thereby come to aſſurance that I am in the ſtate of grace? I muſt look into the Word by a direct act of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a true and undoubted evidence of faith, and into mine own heart by a reflex act, whether that true evidence of ſaving faith be indeed in me. As in the Syllogiſme of aſſurance about my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reſurrection at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the major, That all men ſhall riſe, is in tearms in Scripture: the minor, That I <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Roger</hi> am a man, is not expreſly in Scripture, but depends partly upon faith, as to the eſſentiall notes of a man recorded in Scripture, partly upon ſenſe, I finding by a reflex act, that thoſe eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ſignes of humanity are in me; from both which the concluſion flows neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that I in particular ſhall riſe at the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169758:78"/>day of judgement. And indeed, had not a concluſion drawn partly from faith and partly from ſenſe been firm, Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions had not been a ſolid argument to confirm the reſurrection, which yet he proves partly by Scripture out of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the Prophets and Pſalmes; partly by ſenſe and experience, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24 39, 46. and though it be poſſible in ſome caſes ſenſe may be deceived, yet a man in his right wits may eaſily know that <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> ſenſe is not deceived: And were not this true, no man could poſſibly be convinced of his eſtate, or that he is a ſinner, or that his life is frail and ſhort, or that faith and repentance is his duty, or any other Divine truth that concerns himſelf in particular, ſince its no where ſaid in Scripture, Thou <hi>Roger</hi> art a ſinner, thy life in particular is frail and ſhort, faith and repentance is thy duty; but all theſe in Scripture are expreſſed onely in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tearms. Yet I hope its as true <hi>de fide</hi> that faith and repentance is my duty, as if the Scripture ſhould ſay, Thou
<hi>Roger</hi> muſt believe and repent, &amp;c. The major then in the Syllogiſme of aſſurance is in tearms <hi>de fide.</hi> The minor alſo (as to the truth of the evidence) is expreſly <hi>de fide,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:169758:79"/>but as to the inbeing of the evidence, it depends upon ſenſe and experience; the concluſion is <hi>de fide</hi> by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, though not in expreſs tearms. Now whatſoever is <hi>de fide,</hi> that is ſealed in the Sacrament; ſo are all three Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in the Syllogiſme (though the minor is partly of faith and partly of ſenſe) therefore all three Propoſitions of the Syllogiſme of aſſurance are ſealed by the Sacrament; contrary to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Aſſertion. And ſince the minor in the Syllogiſme of aſſurance (namely, that I believe) is the concluſion in the proſ-Syllogiſme, it follows neceſſarily, that this Propoſition (I believe) is <hi>de fide</hi> by conſequence, though not <hi>de fide</hi> in tearms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The Sacrament ſuppoſeth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and therefore doth not work aſſurance; It ſuppoſeth I believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (which therefore muſt be made out by previous examination) doth not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I believe and repent, and therefore doth not ſeal the <hi>minor</hi> or <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> in the Syllogiſme of aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As the Sacrament works grace, ſo it works aſſurance of grace, and as it is a means of grace, ſo it is a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169758:79"/>means of aſſurance. Now the Sacrament (as received) is not a means of initiall but of progreſſive grace, doth not beget grace at firſt by regeneration, but increaſe and ſtrengthen grace by nouriſhment and confirmation, partly by acting grace, and partly by holding forth, applying, and ſealing the promiſes of the Covenant to every worthy Receiver. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word doth audibly (in order to confirmation) that the Sacrament doth viſibly; what the Word applies generally, that the Sacrament applies particularly; what the Word applies by one ſenſe, that the Sacrament applies by all our ſenſes, and therefore muſt needs be a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull means of aſſurance then the Word. The Word indeed is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe of initiall grace, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily of initiall aſſurance: but the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may be ſometimes the means of initiall aſſurance, and ordinarily is the means and inſtrument of progreſſive aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. My meaning is, that whoſoever comes to the Sacrament rightly prepared, having both truth of grace and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of grace, this man or woman ſhall go away from the Sacrament with more degrees of grace, and clearer evidence of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169758:80"/>grace; and he or ſhe that comes to the Lords Supper with the worthineſs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of preparation, though haply he may want evidence, yet may go away from the Sacrament triumphing in the aſſurance of Gods love. He that comes to the Sacrament with the Prophets fear, <hi>I am undone,</hi> &amp;c. may go away from it with this aſſurance, <hi>Thine iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin purged,</hi> Iſa. 6.5, 7. As I at the Sacrament aſſure God of my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſo God at the Sacrament aſſures me of his love; and if I be reall in my aſſurance as to uprightneſs, God is as reall in his aſſurance as to my comfort,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.25. God in an eſpeciall manner in the Sacrament delights <hi>to ſhew himſelf upright with the upright;</hi> and then if ever <hi>leads</hi> his Spouſe <hi>into the wine cellar</hi> or ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting houſe, and <hi>ſpreads his banner of love over her,</hi> Cant.
2.4. <hi>When ſhe is ſick of love, then he ſtaies her with flagons, and comforts her with apples; His left hand is under her head, and his right hand doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her.</hi> Then in an eſpeciall manner <hi>he kiſſeth her with the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> Cant. 1.1. and though <hi>Judas</hi> did, <hi>Jeſus</hi> will never give a treacherous kiſs.</p>
               <p>The major himſelf grants is ſealed in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169758:80"/>the Sacrament, the minor and concluſion we have proved to be ſealed in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Whereby it appears that the whole Syllogiſme of aſſurance is ſealed by the Sacrament to the worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but onely the major Propoſition to perſons really unworthy. Withall, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is evident, that the Sacrament is not onely Gods ſeal, but alſo the ſeal of faith and of the beleever, whatever Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pretends to the contrary. And ſo I paſs to the fifth Objection, <hi>pag.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. The Covenant belongs not to all, therefore the Seals neither.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> anſwers, The Covenant belongs to all conditionally, <hi>according to the tenour of the Goſpel, that whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So the Sacrament belongs to all conditionally, but onely to worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers abſolutely. <hi>Pag.</hi> 50. he ſaves me a labour, and anſwers himſelf in theſe words,
<hi>If you will reſolve to accept Chriſt as your Lord and Saviour, to forſake ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>lo here is the ſeal of God on his part,</hi> &amp;c. Here indeed he ſhews, That as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ſo the Sacrament belongs to all conditionally. But what if moſt do not, will not accept of Chriſt, &amp;c. (which is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169758:81"/>
                  <hi>de facto</hi> the caſe of groſly ignorant and profane perſons) will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> invite theſe alſo to receive the Seals together with the former?</p>
               <p>Hear him in his own words, pag. 51. <hi>To ſpeak ſincerely, if we ſhould propoſe two men, one that is not in Covenant with Chriſt, and one that is, this Sacrament doth more ingenuouſly belong unto the firſt, &amp;c.</hi> If this be not a rare and new Light, I know not what is. Now you have the man painted by himſelf in his own colours. Come ye drunkards, whoremaſters, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and all the rabble of hell, here is ſincere and comfortable Doctrine for you indeed, The Sacrament doth more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly belong to you then to any that are in covenant with Chriſt. I but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> means this, <hi>in caſe they now reſolve to enter into Covenant with Chriſt, ibid.</hi> Abſurd, and a contradiction <hi>in adjecto,</hi> as if he who in truth reſolves to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Chriſt, were not at that very inſtant in covenant with Chriſt. He would ſay, if he could hit it, The Sacrament belongs more properly to weak then to ſtrong beleevers: but by an ill gloſs he corrupts the Text, and inſtead of a weak beleever renders one out of Covenant,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169758:81"/>and for a ſtrong beleever, one in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. We grant, the duty of the Covenant belongs to all, but not the promiſe of the Covenant till its duty be performed. In like manner, preparation belongs to all, but not actuall receiving till that duty be performed. All are not bid to eat abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but ſo to eat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>In the ſame page by diſtinguiſhing the Covenant from its benefit, he ſeems to make a diſtinction without a difference, as if the benefit of the Covenant were not an eſſentiall part of the Covenant. Haply by Covenant he means the duty or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant which indeed is of <hi>epidemical concernment:</hi> yet becauſe in the ſame place he ſpeaks of a free tender and offer; that croſſes this conſtruction, and ſeems to carry it, that by Covenant there, muſt be meant the benefit of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which is tendred conditionally to all; but then what ſenſe can be made of his diſtinction, The benefit of the Covenant belongs not to any out of Chriſt, but the Covenant it ſelf belongs to all, that is, the benefit of the Covenant (as his ſenſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it) belongs to all? Is not here a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction <hi>in terminis? The benefit of the Covenant belongs not to any out of Chriſt,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169758:82"/>yet the benefit of the Covenant belongs to all.</hi> If it belongs to
<hi>all,</hi> how doth it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to any out of Chriſt? <hi>contrà,</hi> if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to none out of Chriſt, how doth it belong to <hi>all?</hi> But no wonder he falls into ſelf-contradiction, who will venture to contradict the truth.</p>

               <p>To apply the diſtinction: The time of every Sacrament is not a fit ſeaſon for every perſon, whether it be by his own default, or by divine providence. 2. In caſe of preſent incapacity, receiving, though an act of worſhip, is not ſinfully omitted unleſſe that omiſſion be joyned with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Ordinance.

               <p>Fourthly, In a ſtrict ſenſe, Actual recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is not an act of worſhip, no more then preaching, conſecrating and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the Elements is.

For our parts, we beleeve no Sacrament, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it as received, is a means of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but only of confirmation and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and ſuppoſing Baptiſme be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Laver of Regeneration,
<hi>Titus</hi> 3.5. which yet the place proves not; its only ſo by way of ſignification and obſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not by way of cauſality. In regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169758:83"/>and converſion the Word is writ in our hearts, but can any man either Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally or rationally, make the ſeal the cauſe of the writing? Is it not evident that Baptiſme doth not cauſe but preſuppoſe converſion? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. yea and profeſſion too <hi>in adult is,</hi> Acts 8.37. and is called by Divines the Seal of Initiation, not as it initiates us into a ſtate of ſaving grace, but into the body of the viſible Church, and as it may ſeal the truth and benefit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation to perſons converted, but not work Regeneration where it is wanting. Paſſing therefore his flouriſh of denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>à parte eminentiori,</hi> let us ſee how he proves the Sacrament to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>His main Argument is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 55.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a viſible word holding forth Chriſt and the Covenant to the ſight, as the Goſpel doth to the hearing. And</hi> pag. 56. <hi>The Sacrament ſhews forth Chriſts death,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.20.
<hi>Therefore as it doth ſo, it is undoubtedly converting.</hi>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:169758:84"/>we deny not; upon which account we judge it fitting, that whoever will may be preſent at the Lords Supper as well as at Baptiſme. But the great Queſtion is, Whether actuall receiving be a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordinance? And here we challenge the challenger, to give any one inſtance of a perſon converted by receiving the Lords Supper; or to make proof that the act of receiving doth convert. The Sacrament indeed is food to nouriſh, but where is it called an immortall ſeed to beget any to Chriſt?</p>
               <p>For his gloſſe <hi>page</hi> 56. <hi>There is in the Sacrament a Take for converſion, and an Eat for nouriſhment,</hi> It is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and would make againſt the converſion of the Apoſtles who were commanded to take as well as to eat, yet I hope they were not in an unconverted condition. 2. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and eating do both imply and call for acts of faith, but the act of faith muſt needs preſuppoſe the habit of faith, and ſo converſion; He that ſayes, Take, eat, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a man hath an hand to receive and a mouth to feed on, which no uncoverted perſon hath.</p>

The Word is both ſeed and food, not ſo the Sacrament, which indeed may be food or phyſick, but not a ſeed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, nor is any where ſo called in Scripture: And to attribute that to an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance which God hath not put in it, or to expect that from an Ordinance which God hath not promiſed to it, is will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, an humane invention, and a breach of the ſecond Commandment.</p>
               <p>I dare appeal to M. <hi>Humphry</hi> his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon this account. Suppoſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted perſon comes to the Sacrament in his pride and preſumption, ſtouts it ſtill againſt Chriſt laid before him as crucified in and before the conſecration of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the Miniſters explication and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, what evidence doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture give that this man ſhall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that one word <hi>Take,</hi> uttered by the Miniſter at the delivery of the Elements? I doubt not of Gods power, but we muſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169758:85"/>look to his revealed will. The Papiſts ſay, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> converts the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; M. <hi>H.</hi> ſayes <hi>Accipite</hi> converts the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver: we deſire a clear proof of both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can give credit to either. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the word
<hi>Take</hi> as a ſhort and virtual Sermon might convert, yet what thinks he of that perſon who ſtands out againſt that word alſo, can he be converted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall receiving? Then that rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. cannot be univerſally true, <hi>He that cats unworthily eats judgement to himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. for he that is converted by actuall receiving doth not eat judgement but mercy. 2. Suppoſe a man ſhould be converted by that ſhort exhortation, <hi>take,</hi> ſince that may be done by preſence at the Sacrament without actuall receiving, how will it follow that all muſt receive becauſe ſome may be converted by the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receive; any more then that all muſt be aſſured of their ſalvation, becauſe ſome are comforted by the exhortation to aſſurance, which is not immediatly the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor at all the priviledge of unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſons <hi>in ſtatu quo.</hi>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169758:86"/>followes thence but that any one may be preſent to hear and ſee, but only worthy communicants are to receive? and unleſſe he can make out that actuall receiving of the Elements is a converting Ordinance,<note place="margin">Actuall receiving is neither a word, nor an act of God, but meerly an act of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act too, and therefore hath not a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verting power in it.</note> all he pleads from the antecedaneous acts will not conclude his free admiſſion, ſince the fruit of the viſible and audible word, or of Chriſts death declared may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by preſence at the Sacrament though a perſon do not actually receive.

<hi>in adjecto,</hi> but I ſee no warrant in the word why the whole Congregation ſhould not ſtay at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Lords Supper (and that with much profit) as well as at the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Baptiſm, though all do not partake: nor can I look at their ancient <hi>Ite, miſſa eſt,</hi> as a divine precept, but as an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tradition.</p>
               <p>For his inſtance <hi>pag.</hi> 57. <hi>Of a poor hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoul hoping to meet Chriſt at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: 1. If his humiliation and hope be right, he is a worthy receiver and already converted, and ſo not a fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or <hi>medium</hi> to prove M. <hi>H.</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169758:86"/>If his hope and humiliation be not right, then he is in the condition of the former, and by his hypocriſie drawes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilt upon himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This poor ſoul if rightly humbled, hungers after Chriſt, rouls upon him and adheres to him, which are proper acts of ſaving and juſtifying faith, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not riſe up to faith of evidence; nor can any man avoid deſpair unleſſe he lean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt or ſomewhat elſe. All which clearly prove this perſon to be converted, and that therfore the Sacrament is to him only a means of edification and comfort.</p>
               <p>His third inſtance <hi>pag.</hi> 58. of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Emaus,</hi> is to as little purpoſe as the two former; unleſſe he can prove 1. That then they were in the ſtate of nature. 2. That that breaking of bread was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.30. 3. That they were converted by that breaking of bread: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates ſo abſurd, that the very naming of them may be a ſufficient confutation.</p>

                  </note> it is not <hi>by</hi> the Sacrament, it is occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not intentionally a converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
               <p>Here (before I proceed any further) I muſt tell M. <hi>H.</hi> he frames an Objection
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169758:87"/>for us very unhandſomely. A converting Ordinance occaſionally, not intentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, little better then a contradiction, the very notion of an Ordinance implying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ordination or appointment of any thing by his revealed will as a means of converſion, edification, comfort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to the creature; and how this can be properly called a not intentionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance, is to me a paradox. Let him prove actuall receiving to be a converting Ordinance, and we ſhall not doubt but it is ſo intentionally.</p>
               <p>To the Reply M. <hi>H.</hi> anſwers, <hi>That it being granted, the matter is upon the point yeelded, partly becauſe none are expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to come, and partly becauſe all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt be taken for our ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The cauſe is not yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be proved, that actuall receiving is a converting Ordinance, ſince the end of converſion may be attained by preſence at the Sacrament without receiving, but the danger of eating and drinking unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily cannot be incurred without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 29. which yet hath no influence in order to converſion. By pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence much benefit may be gained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of unworthy receiving, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169758:87"/>much guilt may be contracted without hopes of benefit to the unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If receiving be a converting Ordinance, how dares M. <hi>H.</hi> exclude either Children, diſtracted or excommunicated perſons from it, eſpecially ſince theſe have moſt need of it, and thoſe are beſt taught by ſenſe who have not ſo free an exerciſe of reaſon? Yea why ſhould Heathen be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Lords Supper more then the word preached, if it be a converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? Are not they alſo bound to uſe all means and take all occaſions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, to uſe M. <hi>H.</hi> his own words?</p>
               <p>But if all hath been ſaid will not take with us, M. <hi>H.</hi> at laſt hath found out a way, <hi>wholly to root out this ſubtilty which he thinks the ſpirit of errour hath inſinuated into the hearts of many godly men, by three things he hath more to ſay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the way obſerve this mans preſumption and cenſoriouſneſſe; 1. In charging ſo many godly perſons to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with a ſpirit of errour in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. 2. In his confident undertaking wholly to root it out by what he hath to ſay, which though mountains in his own conceit, yet when they come to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169758:88"/>we hope by Gods aſſiſtance to make appear they ſcarce deſerve the name of molehills; and with a ſling and ſtone of Gods making, fear not to incounter with this great and vaunting <hi>Goliah,</hi> who by big words bids defiance to the whole hoaſt of Gods
<hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His firſt grand Argument <hi>pag.</hi> 59. is this, <hi>That the Sacraments and all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are primarily and properly means of grace; and but in a remote ſenſe means of converſion or confirmation: for this grace we receive in the uſe of them, converts ſome and ſtrengthens others: and this grace received in the Sacrament, works in the unregenerate for their converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is not here prime ſtuff worthy of a <hi>Doctor in Cathedrâ?</hi> but to anſwer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. I muſt firſt premiſe that here he ſpeaks not of relative but abſolute, not of externall but internall or inherent grace, for otherwiſe the Ordinances are means of juſtification and adoption as well as of holineſſe, of which laſt yet he muſt be underſtood. This premiſed, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. That if the Ordinances be prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily means of grace, they muſt needs be primarily means of converſion and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſince primary converſion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169758:88"/>elſe but grace at firſt infuſed, and primary confirmation is degrees of the ſame grace ſuperadded.</p>
               <p>For further cleering whereof, and that all the world may ſee how M. <hi>H.</hi> inſtead of informing would blinde and baffle the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautelous or injudicious Reader, we muſt underſtand there is a two-fold converſion; one primary, when God converts and changes the heart by creating grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo making it a new and ſoft heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. turning the Wolf into a Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other ſecondary, when by vertue of grace inherent, aſſiſted by grace externall, we turn our ſelves from ſin to God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31,
32. Now ſince there is no inherent grace, but its formally, and not only efficiently converting or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, its impoſſible initiall grace ſhould be wrought but converſion (which is a change of principles) muſt needs be wrought immediatly alſo: and its as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible degrees of grace ſhould be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added, but thereby formally confirmation muſt be wrought. Is not the change from death to life greater then from a principle of life to an act of life? Now the firſt infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of grace is a change from death to life, and is ſolely Gods act wherein the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169758:89"/>creature is meerly paſſive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. as the dark Chaos was to the light, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2, 3. And this is Gods converting of us, or habituall converſion. Our converting of our ſelves (which is M. <hi>Humphry</hi> his ſole converſion) is nothing but a reflecting of the beam upon the Sonne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in a manner nothing to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer work of divine converſion; this we call actuall converſion; as habituall ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, actuall ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. His aſſertion then is falſe, That the Ordinances are remotely means of converſion, for if the Ordinances be primarily means of converting grace, they muſt needs be primarily means of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſince grace infuſed is primary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but grace acting is ſecondary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. The ſame I might ſay of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation alſo in proportion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It cannot be proved, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall receiving is either primarily or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily a means of converting grace; and therefore will certainly prejudice, but cannot benefit an unconverted perſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How abſurd is the laſt clauſe? <hi>This grace received in the Sacrament, works in the unregenerate for their converſion.</hi> For 1. How is he unregenerate who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169758:89"/>grace which formally regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates him? 2. How can a man be regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and yet at the ſame inſtant uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? yet if Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Doctrine be true, this will follow, ſince a man is regenerated by the habits of grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, which not only in order of nature, but alſo in order of time, may precede the acts of grace (it being not neceſſary, that grace preſent ſhould act immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or at all times.) Now ſince Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> his converſion is nothing but the acting of grace, and the habit of grace infuſed may in time precede the act, and there is no converſion before the act of grace, doth it not hence neceſſarily follow; that a man may be regenerated, and yet at the ſame inſtant of time unconverted, that is at the ſame time in a ſtate of nature, as unconverted, and yet in a ſtate of grace as regenerated? But how abſurd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant is this to true Divinity?</p>
               <p>His ſecond grand Argument is drawn from a diſtinction of converſion, which he makes double, 1. <hi>Outward from Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity; He will not ſay the Sacrament is ſuch a convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinance.</hi> 2. <hi>An effectuall converſion from profeſſion to the truth of grace; and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169758:90"/>thus the Sacrament as a viſible Word doth convert inſtrumentally as well as the Word preached, the Spirit being the principall cauſe of converſion in both Ordinances, &amp;c.</hi> And in the cloſe of pag. 60. <hi>he appeals to experience for the converting power of the Sacrament.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of that Paragraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its ſooner ſaid then proved, that the Sacrament hath converted any, 2. Though it ſhould be granted, that ſome parts of it did convert, what is M. <hi>H.</hi> his cauſe the better, unleſs he prove that actuall receiving doth convert? 3. That the Sacrament ſhould convert onely to truth of grace, and yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to outward profeſſion, is as abſurd, as that the Word preached ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert only to outward profeſſion, and not to truth of grace. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhew me one Scripture, 1. Why Heathen may not be preſent at the Sacrament as well as at the Word preached. 2. Why the viſible Word may not convert to the form, as well as to the power of godlineſs, why it ſhould do the greater and not the leſſer. We expect not dictates but proof and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to convince us of this new Light.</p>
               <p>In the third place <hi>he deſcants, though
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169758:90"/>to little purpoſe, about the Sacraments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting not intentionally, but occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c. To which we briefly anſwer, That whatever other parts of the Sacrament may do, yet actuall receiving converts neither occaſionally nor intentionally, and therefore unconverted perſons ought not to receive, becauſe this Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall action cannot benefit but prejudice them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Unregenerate men are dead in ſin, and bread muſt not be given to dead men, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Mr.</hi> H. <hi>makes to he a fancy.</hi> 2. <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that if any bread could recover life, that bread might be given to a dead man, and ſuch is the bread in the Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi> 3. <hi>That if we may give</hi> Aqua vitae <hi>to dying men, then we may give</hi> Calix vitae <hi>to dead Chriſtians, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its no wonder if ſtrong fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies metamorphize what they pleaſe into a fancy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sacramentall receiving in the Lords Supper notes a vitall act, which a dead man cannot put forth; and be the bread never ſo quickning (upon Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his ſuppoſition) if a dead man cannot receive it, it will not quicken him; as the beſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169758:91"/>Phyſick will not cure, if a living man will not, or cannot receive it. Taking and eating in the Sacrament note (not a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but) an active receiving, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not beget, but preſuppoſe life; which life, grant it may be wrought by other Sacramentall actions, proves only, that preſence, not participation is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His <hi>Simile</hi> is very lame; nor doth it follow, that becauſe we may give
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae</hi> to a dying man, therefore we may give <hi>Calix vitae</hi> to a dead man, ſince a dying man hath life to be preſerved, not ſo a dead man.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of his Reply, in his third Edition he adds three pages by way of explication,
<hi>pag.</hi> 69. which I muſt take a little pains to ſcan and ſift.</p>
               <p>And 1. <hi>He makes confirmation of the Covenant a primary end, confirmation of our faith a ſecuodary end of the Lords Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I wiſh Mr. <hi>H.</hi> did not ſhew himſelf as little skill'd in Morality as in Logick. Let him tell me ſeriouſly (for no doubt, being Maiſter of Arts, he hath ſpent ſome time at the Univerſity in Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks as well as in Logick) Is not the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169758:91"/>principall or laſt End the primary End? and ſubordinate Ends are not they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Ends? If ſo, then the next queſtion will be, Whether the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant be not ſubordinate to the confirmation of our faith? In plain tearms, Whether Gods end in confirming the Covenant by the Sacrament as a Seal, be not to confirm the faith of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiver? If ſo, then the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant hath the notion of a means in order to the confirmation of faith as an End. Now let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf judge whether confirmation of faith be not a primary End, and confirmation of the Covenant a ſecondary End, quite contrary to his former Aſſertion?</p>
               <p>In his following words he would very fain (by compliance and ſome conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) court us into his own opinion, that the Sacrament is a converting Ordinance though but eventually;
<hi>Which,</hi> ſaies he, pag.71. <hi>Will ſerve to blunt the ſtrength of the Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He muſt pardon us if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant him that, till he can bring us better ground from Scripture and reaſon then yet we can ſee. 2. Grant the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious actions of prayer, explication, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169758:92"/>exhortation, may be converting (upon which we yeeld an univerſall preſence at the whole Ordinance) yet unleſs Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can prove, that actuall receiving doth convert, our Argument (drawn from the <hi>non</hi>-converting power of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is not blunted.</p>
               <p n="2">2, Whereas in the ſame Page he adds, <hi>When I ſay its a means of converting ſome, I take it in its full adminiſtration, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring duties before, in, and after receiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Then belike conversion depends more upon our preparation, celebration, and after carriages, then upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as an Inſtrument. Here is a plain faulter; for a converting Ordinance (when God pleaſes) will convert, come the ſubject never ſo unprepared, yea with never ſo malicious an heart: And though preparation be neceſſary for all,
<hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate praecepti,</hi> yet it is not neceſſary for converſion to any,
<hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs divers who when they came malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to catch the Miniſter, have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves been caught and converted.</p>
               <p>Its more abſurd which he adds, <hi>That the Sacrament is a means of converſion, by the help of after duty.</hi> For beſides that, hence its apparent, this Receiver was not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169758:92"/>converted at the Sacrament, and ſo did but eat and drink judgement to himſelf. Will it not by this rule follow, that even unworthy receiving it ſelf, is a means of converſion, ſince by after duty a man may be brought to a ſight of his great ſin, and thereby may be humbled and converted? May not any ſin by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be a means of converſion, or (in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his phraſe) a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſince by after carriage a man may be brought to a ſight and ſenſe of his ſin, and ſo converted? We ſay, unworthy receiving, and ſo other ſins may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but net means of converſion. God can make an antidote of poyſon, but he is mad who upon that account will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to drink poyſon.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Page he adds, <hi>Then I hold that we who are baptized into the Church, and are bred up to a generall faith (ſuch as it is) not without its fruits; and ſo have a right unto the Ordinance, coming as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly as we can, and bewayling our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſs, may finde grace in the ſight of God, even to the beſtowing of a ſpeciall juſtifying faith for our inward effectuall converſion in the uſe of it. The main har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in this field of</hi> Boaz
<hi>belongs to his own
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169758:93"/>reapers, yet I would afford ſome gleanings for poor</hi> Ruth <hi>the</hi> Moabiteſs, <hi>and ſuffer many a doubtfull, penitently inclined, yet unregenerate ſoul, to come up even to the ſheaves, hoping my fellow labourers will not grudge at it, though I have let fall ſome handfulls too on purpoſe for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its a novell expreſſion to ſay we are baptized into the Church; we reade of baptizing into Chriſt, but not in Scripture of baptizing into the Church; is it not as abſurd, <hi>Baptizari in Eccleſiam,</hi> as <hi>Credere in Eccleſiam?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How many are not ſo much as bred up to a generall faith, but are as ignorant as the very <hi>Indians,</hi> that never heard of Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What fruits have many bred up to a generall faith, unleſs it be open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs, ſcoffing at Religion and Duties both publick and private: Shall not theſe (againſt his generall Aſſertion) be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own preſent verdict?</p>
               <p n="4">4. What naturall man ever did his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to come preparedly? and therefore by Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> his own principle held forth to this Paragraph, 1. Ought not to receive. And 2. Cannot be converted by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169758:93"/>3. His alluſion to the caſe of <hi>Ruth,</hi> is 1. Abſurd. 2. Impertinent. Abſurd, in that he ſaies, <hi>The main harveſt in this field of</hi> Boaz
<hi>belongs to his own reapers.</hi> This in the Letter is falſe, ſince the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt belonged not to the reapers, but to <hi>Boaz</hi> himſelf; it belonged no more to the reapers, then to the oxen or aſſes that carried it away to <hi>Boaz</hi> his barn, nay haply not ſo much. 2. Its imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as miſapplied, he comparing unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſons to <hi>Ruth</hi> the
<hi>Moabiteſs,</hi> and yet forgetting himſelf, he tells us, theſe unregenerate perſons are penitently inclined. His meaning ſeems to be, They are Heathen as unregenerate, and yet Chriſtians as Profeſſors and penitently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Such <hi>Ruths</hi> we ſhall not grudge if he let ſome handfuls fall unto them. We undertake not to judge of mens hearts whether they be regenerate or not, but proceed by the rule of viſibility, and ſhall willingly admit perſons peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently inclined; but are withall ſatisfied, that perſons groſly ignorant or ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are not <hi>in ſtatu quo</hi> penitently incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therefore by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his own principles, are not to be admitted as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169758:94"/>of the Lords Supper, though they may be preſent, and that with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, at the whole Ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 7. <hi>Judas</hi> received not the Lords Supper, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To evade the force of this Objection, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in two leaves takes ſome pains, though to ſmall purpoſe, to prove that <hi>Judas</hi> received. His ground is, <hi>Becauſe</hi> Judas <hi>was preſent at the Lords Supper, and Chriſt bid all preſent to receive.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.27. &amp; <hi>Mark</hi> 14.23. where its ſaid,
<hi>They all drank</hi> of the Sacramentall Cup.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Its the judgement of divers learned, that <hi>Judas</hi> did not receive. 2. Grant him preſent at the Sacrament, it follows not thence, that he did receive. 3. Chriſt bidding all to receive muſt be limited onely to <hi>thoſe all</hi> for whom he ſhed his blood for remiſſion of ſins, as is evident in the words that accompany the tender of the Cup. Compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. But Chriſts blood was nor ſhed for
<hi>Judas</hi> for the remiſſion of ſins, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Sacrament was not tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. It ſeems probable that Chriſt excluded <hi>Judas</hi> in particular in thoſe words <hi>Luke</hi> 22.21. <hi>But behold, the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169758:94"/>hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the table.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, What haſt thou (who art a Traytor) to do to receive among my faithfull Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?
5. Suppoſing be did receive, 1. Chriſt acted (in admitting him) as a particular Miniſter, who alone cannot exclude any. 2. Before and at receiving he told him home his ſin and danger, which I believe Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth not to every <hi>Judas</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives at his Sacrament.
<hi>Judas</hi> his inſtance then will not favour Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 8. Unworthy Receivers are guilty of Chriſt blood, and eat their own damnation; therefore we muſt not allow free admiſſion.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> anſwers, <hi>That it cannot concern the admitters and joyners,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It concerns the admitters, if any partake who are viſibly unworthy, and the joyners if they know them to be unworthy, and do not complain; the rule being, that a man muſt receive <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, but not abſolutely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>p.</hi> 68. he adds, <hi>Every one is to examine himſelf, if he do not,</hi> he receives his own damnation, <hi>not ours, who do our duty,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>ver.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles words are not to be underſtood reſtrictively and excluſively, as if ſelf examination excluded Church examination, or as if ſelf prejudice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded prejudice to my neighbour; as is evident by comparing <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. where giving an account to God, excludes not giving an account to man, for then chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſervants might refuſe to give any account to their parents or maſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though it be haply an improper expreſſion to ſay, I eat judgement to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yet undoubtedly another mans unworthy receiving may be charged upon me, when I have power to prevent it and do not. I think (as perfect as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is) both himſelf and the beſt of Gods people had need pray every day, Lord forgive me my other mens ſins; eſpecially State and Church Officers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Its as abſurd in reaſon and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by an affirmative to exclude a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, as it is by a negative to exclude an affirmative: to ſay, I muſt examine
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169758:95"/>my ſelf, therefore another muſt not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine me; or to ſay, Another muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine me, therefore I muſt not examine my ſelf: or to ſay, I eat judgement to my ſelf, therefore not to another, as to ſay, I eat judgement to another, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to my ſelf. Moſt ſins and duties are reciprocall; and as guilt, ſo duty is uſually relative as well as perſonall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>If a man drink poyſon, ſhall not I be guilty of his blood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I hinder him</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> anſwers, 1. <hi>Not, unleſs I have a</hi> quum poſſum. 2. <hi>He wonders any ſhould compare the Sacrament to a cup of poyſon, ſeeing it is in its own nature a cup of bleſſing.</hi> 3. <hi>That it is more then we can know or ought to judge, that it proves death to any.</hi> 4. <hi>That as the Word may be preached to all (though often it prove the ſavour of death) ſo the Sacrament may be adminiſtred unto all, leaving the iſſue to God, &amp;c.</hi> This for the admitters part, <hi>pag.</hi> 68.70.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. His <hi>quum poſſit</hi> muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood either of a naturall or a morall ability. I believe that whoever hath a naturall, hath at the ſame time a morall ability to hinder his brother from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf by poyſon. In plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169758:96"/>whoever can, ought to hinder his brother from drinking of poyſon.
<hi>Cains</hi> Religion may be indeed, <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> but Chriſts Religion is,
<hi>He that ſaves not life, deſtroyes it.</hi> I muſt preſerve my neighbours life by all lawfull means; but undoubtedly its a lawfull means by violence to hinder my neighbour from ſelf murder.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His wonder deſerves to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at. If one mans corporall food be another mans poyſon (though in it ſelf wholſome, as Cheeſe, &amp;c.) why may not one mans ſpirituall food be another mans poyſon? Nay, the ſame food is at one time good nouriſhment, at another time poyſon to the ſame man, namely fleſh, &amp;c. in a ſtrong feaver. The ſame Word is a favour of life and a ſavour of death, and why not the ſame Sacrament, and what is a deadly ſavour but poyſon? Chriſt is a precious corner ſtone to ſome, a ſtone of ſtumbling to others; and if Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall be ſo, why not Chriſt Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If I may know and judge when the Word is poyſon to any, why not as well, yea better, when the Sacrament is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? I may know the Word is ſo by its
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169758:96"/>effects or conſequents: I may know the Sacrament is ſo, both by its cauſes and effects; as if a groſly ignorant or profane perſon come to receive, and if after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving I ſee a man as bad or worſe then formerly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the Word may be preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, ſo the Sacrament may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred before all, but as the Word is not applied by all, nor divers parts of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to all, ſo neither ought the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be applied to all by actuall receiving. If any man will give his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour poyſon, and leave the iſſue to God, the Magiſtrate may more juſtly give him an halter, and leave the iſſue to God.</p>
               <p>Next Mr. <hi>H.</hi> proceeds <hi>to the Receivers part,</hi> and tels us, pag. 70. <hi>That a double duty is required of him,</hi> 1. <hi>A principall, Do this.</hi> 2. <hi>An acceſſory, Let a man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf. We are bound to come. and to come worthily. If a man fails in the one, and is not ſufficiently prepared, I dare not ſay that he muſt keep (I am ſure it will not excuſe him) from the other, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Let the Reader note how abſurdly Mr. <hi>H.</hi> makes <hi>receiving</hi> to be the principall duty, and actuall worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but acceſſory. What carnall Divinity
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169758:97"/>is this, to make the matter and carkaſs of a duty the principall, and the ſpirit of a duty acceſſory; the form of godlineſs the principall and the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the acceſſory? Is not this principall Divinity, and very pleaſing to ſome of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his principall Receivers?</p>
               <p n="2">2. His doubtfull, expreſſion about co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, though unprepared, evidences his heſitancy about that particular, and not without juſt cauſe. True, he that is bound to come, is bound to come wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; but not, <hi>contra,</hi> he that is bound to come worthily, is bound to come ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, no more then he that was bound to come circumciſed and pure to the Paſſeover, was bound to come abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteſy. Every <hi>Jew</hi> was bound to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, pure, and ſo to come to the Paſſeover; but had he neglected Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and Purification, he was not to eat the Paſſeover at that time. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, every Chriſtian is bound to be, 1. Habitually worthy. 2. Actually wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. 3. And <hi>ſo</hi> to receive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. yet is not bound to receive, but rather to abſtain if he want either of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The Apoſtle doth not ſay, Let a man eat abſolutely; but <hi>ſo let him eat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:169758:97"/>3. Sinfull unpreparedneſs will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a man from guilt, but unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs either ſinfull or lawfull, will excuſe him from receiving. A negative unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs will excuſe children and thoſe who have urgent and juſt occaſions that hinder them from receiving; not ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative unpreparedneſs. He that travelled of purpoſe to avoid the Paſſeover, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; not ſo he who had juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary occaſions to travell, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.10, 13. But be unpreparedneſs negative or priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that man at preſent ought not to receive, though he ſin in bringing a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neceſſity of abſtinence upon himſelf. None are threatned ſimply for not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but all are threatned in caſe they receive unworthily.</p>
               <p>For further explication and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> propounds three Quaeries.</p>
               <p n="1">Qu. <hi>Whether the very eating and drinking of an unworthy Receiver be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi> He means, <hi>Whether it deſerve damnation? He anſwers, by diſtinguiſhing between the act of receiving, which is good, and the unworthineſs, which makes the ſin onely; and concludes, That his abſtinence from, is a greater ſin then his unworthy receiving of the Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 71.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:169758:98"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Receiving is alwaies a ſin in him that is unworthy, 1. Becauſe he cannot but receive unworthily, but that act which cannot be abſtracted from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pravity in dominion, is neceſſarily ſin. 2. Becauſe he is threatned, but God threatens for nothing but ſin. Eating is not in it ſelf a ſin, yet for a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to eat the ſin-offering, was a ſin: So receiving ſimply is no ſin, but an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſon cannot receive without ſin. There is no ſinfull act in the world, but notionally you may abſtract ſinfulneſs from it, but really you cannot when it comes to be acted; no more can you from an unworthy perſons receiving, which is ſinfull, 1. In the manner. 2. As prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to ſuch a perſon <hi>in ſtatu quo.</hi> He is bound indeed to get worthineſs, and then to receive: but he is not bound to receive till he be Evangelically worthy. As a naturall man ought firſt to get grace and then aſſurance, but not to ſtudy aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance without grace.</p>

               <p>In his new Edition, <hi>pag.</hi> 85. he inſerts three pages more for amplification of the eighth Objection.

<hi>The alteration is made onely in us, the ſeal is the ſame, and what is ſealed is the ſame.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is not here an apparent falſity, as to the latter branch of the Anſwer, unleſs he will make ſalvation and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be one and the ſame thing? If ſalvation be ſealed to the worthy, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the unworthy Receivers, then ſurely though the ſeal be the ſame, yet what is ſealed is not the ſame thing. As (to uſe his own ſimilitude) though the Sun be the ſame, yet the ſunſhine and the ſhadow, or light and darkneſs are not the ſame, but privative contraries.

               <p>Rep. <hi>But ſuppoſe a poor ſoul doubts of his faith, does this bring any relief to him uncertain of the Condition?</hi>

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:169758:100"/>Anſw. <hi>Methinks it doth; the condition of the Covenant may be conſidered as in</hi> eſſe, <hi>already wrought in us, or in</hi> fieri, <hi>as to be done or performed of us. The Receiver ſeals not neceſſarily to the condition in</hi> eſſe,
<hi>but in</hi> fieri <hi>obliging himſelf for the future to believe and obey,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. True, the Sacrament may bring relief to a doubting ſoul, who hath indeed truth of grace, but doubts of it. But what relief can it bring to one that doubts groundedly, and hath no grace at all? 1. It cannot convert him (underſtand me ſtill of actuall receiving) as hath been formerly ſhewed. 2. It cannot confirm him, unleſs it be in ſin, by ſealing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him. For can he be confirmed in grace who hath no grace at all?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where he ſaies, The Receiver ſeals not neceſſarily to the condition <hi>in eſſe,</hi> but <hi>in fieri,</hi> I anſwer, He ſeals as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily (in point of duty) to the condition <hi>in eſſe</hi> or <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> as <hi>in fieri</hi> or <hi>de futuro,</hi> and that man who ingages not to believe at preſent, plaies the hypocrite in inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to believe hereafter. It is not with elicit as with imperate acts; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he that truly wills them, doth in part perform them, whence Divines
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169758:100"/>make a true deſire of faith one degree of faith, and he that in truth deſires and reſolves to beleeve hereafter, may as well act that reſolution now, ſince faith it ſelf as well as the reſolution of faith is an act of the will. And this M. <hi>H.</hi> would ſpeak in thoſe words, <hi>Page</hi> 86. <hi>If he reſolve now for the time to come without procraſtination to walk according to the Covenant.</hi> Is not faith the firſt ſtep of this walk ? He that reſolves in truth to beleeve, cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to beleeve, and the true deſire of faith, is both Scripturally and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Divines one degree of faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By the very act of receiving, he ſeals to faith <hi>in eſſe</hi> or <hi>de praeſenti</hi> in point of profeſſion; the very language of his receiving the Elements is, I receive Chriſt ſignified and offered to me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular by them; and therefore he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Elements and doth not act faith at the ſame inſtant, he playes the hypocrite wofully, mocks God and Chriſt, and as the mockers of Chriſt were guilty of his death, ſo is every unworthy receiver.</p>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 86. He proceeds. <hi>The faith therefore that is abſolutely requiſite to a beleever is not aſſurance, but conſiſts, I take it, of theſe two things only,</hi> 1.
<hi>An hiſtoricall aſſent to

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I eaſily grant aſſurance is not abſolutely requiſite as a means, but only in point of duty (namely that every one is bound to labour after it,) and in order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our <hi>benè eſſe</hi> or comfort. 2. Againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sacrament a Chriſtian is bound in an eſpeciall manner by ſoul-ſearching exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to make out his evidence; and if he have truth of grace and take pains to ſearch, he will by Gods grace finde ſo much truth in himſelf, as may bring him to ſome aſſent about his good eſtate, though uſually this aſſent be much aſſaulted and weakned with doubting, for removing whereof the Sacrament is an eſpeciall help. But 3. Whereas M. <hi>H.</hi> profeſſeth to know no other kindes or ingredients of ſaving or juſtifying faith, but only an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall aſſent and a good purpoſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. 1. I muſt tell him he is very defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive on the one hand as omitting the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall act of juſtifying faith, namely adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or leaning upon Chriſt for justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſalvation, which is an act of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169758:101"/>will, not of the underſtanding; nor will his hiſtoricall faith for kinde go beyond the faith of hypocrites, yea of devils, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.19. and will aggravate a mans damnation if the faith of adherence follow not upon it. 2. I muſt alſo tell him he is as exceſſive on the other in miſtaking a good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a conſtitutive part of faith, which is either an antecedent or a conſequent and effect of faith, antecedent if it be a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, conſequent if an evangelicall reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I wiſh M. <hi>H.</hi> would ſtudy fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls better, before he come to be ſo criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call about ſuperſtructures.</p>
               <p>By his following diſcourſe <hi>pag.</hi> 89. its apparent he ſpeaks very confuſedly about the ſpirituall eſtate of a Chriſtian. For 1. He ſuppoſeth a man hath not ſaving grace, and yet that at the ſame time he is willing to accept of Chriſt, to leave ſin and yeeld to Chriſts termes, all which are moſt precious ſaving graces. Afterwards he compares theſe graces to a little gold mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much droſſe in a lump of Ore, yet at laſt concludes God can make grace of theſe leaſt beginnings, as if at preſent they were not grace till God does as it were tranſubſtantiate them and turn our water into wine. By all which its apparent the

               <p>
                  <hi>Contra,</hi> We hold that no perſon really unworthy ought to receive. 2. That no

Let the Reader then take notice how guilty M. <hi>H.</hi> is of his own fallacy, in making the Reader beleeve we are againſt all Sacraments, or againſt all mixed Sacraments, becauſe we judge that perſons really unworthy ought not <hi>in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu quo</hi> to receive, and perſons viſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſhould not by the Church be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to receive.</p>

His inſtance of conjugall ſociety will not help him, there being an expreſſe commandment for that in Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13, 14. not ſo for mixed communion at the Sacrament with perſons viſibly unworthy, if it lye in my power to prevent it: And though I ſin not ſimply in receiving with them to which private Chriſtians may ſometimes be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated; yet I ſin if I do not my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prevent their receiving who or viſibly unworthy and will not be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by admonition.</p>
               <p>And this may ſerve by way of anſwer to his Reply, <hi>pag.</hi> 85. whereby he ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Objection: And whereas he adds, <hi>Now it is one thing to eat at home (an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent action) where I am left to my own ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration; and another to eat at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which 1 am bound unto as a piece of Gods ſervice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lanſwer. 1. That as eating at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a duty, ſo naturall eating is a duty, which cannot be neglected without guilt of ſelf-murther. 2. As when I can I
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169758:106"/>ought to avoid eating at my own houſe with a ſcandalous perſon, ſo when I can (without ſin) I ought to avoid eating at the Sacrament with a ſcandalous perſon.
3. As I ought not to avoid eating with a ſcandalous perſon to endanger my life or health, ſo I ought not with the hazard of my ſpirituall life and health to avoid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall eating with a ſcandalous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 4. As when a ſcandalous perſon will obtrude himſelf to my table, I ought by all lawfull means to exclude him, ſo when the ſame perſon will obtrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon Gods table, I ought by the uſe of all lawfull means to keep him off, by which if I cannot prevail, I may without guilt eat with him both at my owntable and at the Lords table; and the fault ſhall lye upon upon him who had power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clued him but would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That an excommunicated perſon is to be excluded in generall from all Chriſtian communion,</hi> as M. <hi>H.</hi> would have it, <hi>pag.</hi> 85. is 1. Falſe doctrine, 2. Bloudy and cruel do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, there being nothing in Scripture to warrant it, and much in the rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt it: grant an excommunicated perſon is diſmembred and caſt out of the Church, and that he is to be as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169758:107"/>and a Publican, you cannot deny him the liberties of one without, or of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and a Publican; but a Publican might come to the Temple to pray, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.10. and an Heathen might come to the Church to hear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. Further, ſince excommunication it ſelf is medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinall, why ſhould it not be backt with publike and private exhortations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14, 15. Can it be imagined that his baniſhment from, will do him more good then his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at publike Ordinances? And this is the more ſtrong againſt M. <hi>M.</hi> who <hi>pag.</hi> 16. applies 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 14. to the caſe of excommunication; and if perſons excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated muſt be admoniſhed as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, why ſhould they be debarred of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at the Word preached, one great part whereof is admonition, eſpecially of the unruly, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14.
<hi>Acts</hi> 20.31. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. And certainly if admonition in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall be an Ordinance, yet applicable to perſons excommunicated, is it not then as clear as the Sunne, that excommunication doth not barre a perſon from all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or from all Ordinances? the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to which notwithstanding is one of M. <hi>H.</hi> his new Lights, <hi>p.</hi> 85.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:169758:107"/>But why ſhould I ſhun an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated perſon more in civil then in ſacred ſociety? Compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe in moſt parts of ſacred ſociety there is not that mutuall familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is ſo great a teſtimony of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall reſpect; nay perſons may often meet at Ordinances, and yet not ſo much as know one the other. 2. There is farre more neceſſity of ſacred then of civill ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, whether in way of duty or of means. Excommunicetion excuſeth not from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though it make a perſon uncapable of ſome priviledges; nor can anothers excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication excommunicate me either from duty or priviledge. Gods children muſt preſent themſelves before God though Satan himſelf come in among them,
<hi>Iob</hi> 1.6. and 2.1.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe places, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15.19. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. Though they reach not the caſe of the Sacrament immediatly and in termes, yet they come home to it in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and naturall conſequence, ſince it concerns Miniſters to ſeparate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious from the vile practically as well as doctrinally, in the Sacrament as well as in other Ordinances: And certainly, they
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169758:108"/>who have power to excommunicate from all Ordinances (as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> teaches) have much more power to excommunicate from ſome: and if partiall or graduall Excommunication be an offence, ſure its an errour on the right hand; better of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in too much lenity then ſeverity. They who have power to deprive of all priviledges, have power to deprive of ſome, and he that may caſt a perſon out of the Church, may turn him out of the Chancell, as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> elſewhere phraſes it.</p>
               <p>From arguing he falls to wiſhing, <hi>p.</hi> 86. Let us ſee whether he be better skill'd in in the Optative then in the Indicative Mood.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His firſt wiſh is for a Government eſtabliſhed in the Church, the neereſt in Chriſtian prudence to the Word God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Sir, Your deſire is granted in ſome parts of the Nation; and had it not been in a great meaſure for the negligence of too many Miniſters, and refractorineſs of moſt people, the Government you wiſh for, might long ere this have been fettled all the Nation over.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſecond wiſh is, <hi>That the duty of fraternall correption, inſpection, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169758:108"/>were better known and practiſed amongſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I can heartily ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to this wiſh alſo: and hope he will not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that this wiſh is in part granted alſo; and in particular, that himſelf is in this diſcourſe made an object of fraternall correption. He that values admonition, is in a fair way to be mended by admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third wiſh is, <hi>That men would look more into their own conſciences, and leave the judging of others ſpirits, hearts, and reynes, alone to the judgement ſeat of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> An excellent wiſh; and had it been as well practiſed as wiſhed by Mr.
<hi>H.</hi> he would not have been ſo harſh a cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his brethren, as this Plea for free admiſſion proves him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His fourth wiſh is, <hi>That though there may be ſome judging by the fruits, That wiſe and religious men would be more cautious of countenancing theſe ſeparations in the viſible Church; ſeeing upon the ſame ground that you go to gather a Church out of his mixt Congregation, another will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſeparation out of your Church, and ſo in</hi> infinitum, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:169758:109"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſee a good heart is better then a wiſe head. Could we wiſh better, and diſpute leſs, how ſoon ſhould we cloſe in a good agreement? How happy had it been for <hi>England,</hi> if godly perſons had not countenanced ſeparation? But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Doctrine or our practice have occaſioned it, let the world judge. Had not ſinfull mixtures brought us to a Chaos, this ſpirit of ſeparation had not probably been hatcht in the hearts of Gods <hi>Nazarites.</hi> A prudent and pious ſeparation had prevented theſe fooliſh and ſinfull ſeparation. The more Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and others turn Church-levellers, and lay all common, the more carefull had we need be of our propriety and inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Weeds may be tolerated in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs or Common, but are intolerable in Chriſts incloſed Garden, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12. at leaſt weeds in this Garden cannot expect all the priviledges of good herbs. How juſtly may he at laſt be lookt at as a weed by our great Husbandman, who contrary to rule and office will cheriſh weeds in Paradiſe, where he is ſet by God to till it, and to keep it.</p>
               <p>I have done with Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> But muſt indeavour to ſatisfie one ſcruple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169758:109"/>I ſhake hands with my Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Do you think all are ignorant or ſcandalous, who refuſe triall hefore the Elderſhip? If not, how can you deny them the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God forbid. Yet firſt, obſtinate Refuſers give too much occaſion of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition in one of the former kinds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatever any may pretend againſt the Government, what is that to the giving an account of their faith or hope to any ſhall ask it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. eſpecially upon juſt grounds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do not they ſuſpend themſelves, who will keep from the Sacrament rather then ſubmit to a duty ſo eaſie, righteous, edifying, and honourable?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whatever may be done by way of extraordinary diſpenſation (where there is very good evidence of ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and true piety) yet ſuch conſider not what a gap they open to ſhake, if not break, the whole frame of Government. Who will not pretend conſcience to ſcape triall when ſuch ill preſidents ſhall ſtand upon record for rules? And whether ſome few truly godly perſons or the whole Church ſhould ſurfer, I leave it
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169758:110"/>to their judgement who underſtand how much the <hi>whole</hi> is to be preferred before divers parts. Let us not ſtudy to pleaſe our ſelves, but ſeek thoſe things which tend to peace and edifying. Yet if any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Churches of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deo gloria, Eccleſiae pax &amp; Reformatio.</hi>
